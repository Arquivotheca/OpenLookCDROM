<H1>Converting SunView Applications to XView</H1>
<P>This chapter contains the complete text of the book
<I>XView Version 2 Reference Manual: Converting SunView Applications</I>.
This book discusses converting olde SunView applications to The X Window
System via the XView toolkit.
This book was widely circulated on the Internet as part of Sun's initial
public source-code distribution of Version 2 of XView.
<P>While we are now on version Three of XView, the conversion 
process differs little, and we were unable to obtain Version Three
of this book in PostScript form, so we're including the Version Two
edition of the book.
