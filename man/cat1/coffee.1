       _C_o_f_f_e_e is a network-based coffee pot monitor, analogous to
       faces,  vismon,  et. al.  It displays the general state of
       the coffee pot, such as  full,  half-full,  old-and-bitter
       coffee, or completely empty.  The present version is manu-
       ally operated with timeouts.

       The program can be invoked in a  command-line  environment
       with one of the arguments ffuullll,, hhaallff,, uugghh eemmppttyy or ssttaattuuss..
       These respectively set the status to full, half,  old-and-
       undrinkable, or empty, and display the status.

       If invoked with any other argument, the program creates an
       X Window System icon displaying  one  of  the  four  modes
       shown above; in this case, all arguments are passed to the
       X library (currently XView) so you  can  specify  -display
       xxx:0, -WP x y, etc. (it is safe to say "coffee X" or sim-
       ilar if you want the display on localhost:0).  Opening the
       icon  gives  you  a set of buttons that let you select the
       appropriate mode;  the  window  auto-iconifies  after  you
       select a mode.

       If invoked with no argument, it prints a status message.

FFIILLEESS
       The  path  to  STATFILE is hardcoded in the coffee.h file.
       It normally refers  to  an  NFS-mounted  file  in  a  pub-
       writable directory.

BBUUGGSS
       A broadcast RPC mechanism would have been  better  than  a
       status file.

       There is no way to indicate ``coffee is made but we're out
       of milk.''

       There should be an odor sensor which would  indicate  when
       the  coffee  has turned bitter.  Or a weight sensor, and a
       guage display, to indicate exact fullness.  These will  be
       incorporated in a future release, shortly after the Brook-
       lyn Bridge changes hands.

       There ought to be a TimBits option. - rph

       You tend to drink more coffee when you can see whenever  a
       fresh  pot is available. Such is the price of omniscience.

       Brewed coffee always smells better than it tastes.
