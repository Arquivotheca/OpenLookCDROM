       This  command  is  available with the OpenWindows environ-
       ment.  For information about installing OpenWindows, refer

       cclloocckk  is  an  OpenWindows XView utility that displays the
       current time in a window or icon. When the window is open,
       cclloocckk  can  display  the time in  either analog or digital
       format.  The clock window is scalable in either format.

UUSSAAGGEE
       When the cclloocckk window is open, it has a floating menu from
       which you can bring up a property window.  From this prop-
       erty sheet, you can modify the  display  of  the  tool  by
       selecting either the AAnnaalloogg or DDiiggiittaall choice box.
              SSeeccoonnddss::
                     On the analog version, this selection starts
                     a second hand on the face of the  clock.  On
                     the  digital  version, it adds two digits to
                     the digital readout.
              DDaattee::
                     Turns on a date display for both analog  and
                     digital versions of cclloocckk..

BBUUGGSS
       If  you  reset the system time, cclloocckk will not reflect the
       new time until you change its window state  from  open  to
       icon,  or  vice versa.  To reset the system time, see ddaattee
       (1V).

       The date display does not go well  with  the  round  clock
       face.

       Occasionally,  when  cclloocckk  is uncovered, the face will be
       visually corrupted. Use the RReeffrreesshh button from the  frame
       menu to repair.
