       _C_o_n_t_o_o_l  captures  and  displays  any messages sent to the
       system  console.   Each  message  is  timestamped  as   it
       arrives.   The  messages are displayed in a scrolling text
       window, so the user can scroll through old messages.

       When a message arrives, ccoonnttooooll will beep and, if  closed,
       begin  blinking  its  icon  until the user opens the tool.
       This behavior can be changed by modifying the default con-
       tool properties.

       _C_o_n_t_o_o_l  must  be  run under either Open Windows or X Win-
       dows.  It accepts the standard Open Windows  command  line
       options.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --cc _f_i_l_e
              specifies an alternate configuration file.  _C_o_n_t_o_o_l
              normally reads its configuration  information  from
              the  path specified in the CONTOOL_FILTERS environ-
              ment  variable  or,  if  CONTOOL_FILTERS   is   not
              defined, from ~/.contool.

       --ff     forces  _c_o_n_t_o_o_l  to fork itself into the background
              after acquiring the console.  This option  is  most
              useful  when  starting _c_o_n_t_o_o_l from your ~/.xinitrc
              or ~/.openwin-init file, where multiple  tools  are
              started  in  the  background.   Even  if _c_o_n_t_o_o_l is
              started first, other tools may  begin  running  and
              produce  error  messages before _c_o_n_t_o_o_l can acquire
              the console.  By using the --ff option you can  start
              _c_o_n_t_o_o_l  in  the foreground, preventing other tools
              from starting until _c_o_n_t_o_o_l has acquired  the  con-
              sole.

       --ii _i_n_p_u_t
              specifies  an alternate input source.  _C_o_n_t_o_o_l nor-
              mally reads messages from the system  console.   If
              --ii  is  used,  _c_o_n_t_o_o_l  will read messages from the
              specified _i_n_p_u_t.  _I_n_p_u_t must be the pathname  of  a
              either  a  FIFO, or a character special device like
              /dev/tty.  _I_n_p_u_t can also be given as "-", indicat-
              ing  that  contool  should  read  messages from its
              standard input.

       --ll     enables logging when  _c_o_n_t_o_o_l  starts.   Initially,
              _c_o_n_t_o_o_l  does  not  log  messages  to a file.  This
              option allows logging to be started  automatically.

              Logging  behavior  can  be enabled and disabled via
              the "File" menu (see below).

       --LL _l_o_g_f_i_l_e
              specifies an alternate log file.  The value of _l_o_g_-
              _f_i_l_e  overrides any log file stored in the configu-
              ration file.  The --ll and --LL options  used  together
              allow multiple copies of contool to be started on a
              single machine, with each copy logging to a differ-
              ent  file,  without  having  to create and maintain
              multiple configuration files.

       --nn     prevents _c_o_n_t_o_o_l from acquiring the console when it
              starts.   This  is  most  useful when testing a new
              version of contool, so that the test copy does  not
              interfere with any previously running console tool.

       _C_o_n_t_o_o_l presents the user with a control panel  containing
       three  buttons  and a scrolling text window.  Console mes-
       sages appear in the text  window;  _c_o_n_t_o_o_l's  behavior  is
       managed with the FFiillee, VViieeww, and EEddiitt buttons.  These but-
       tons have several menu choices associated with them:

       FFiillee:: LLooaadd CCoonnffiigguurraattiioonn......
              brings up the LLooaadd CCoonnffiigguurraattiioonn dialog box.   This
              dialog  contains  a  non-exclusive  setting, a text
              field, and a single LLooaadd button.  The  setting  has
              two  entries: "Tool Properties" and "Filter Defini-
              tions".  The user can choose which of  these  items
              to  load  from the configuration file.  The default
              action is to load both properties and filters  from
              the file.

              The  text field contains the path of the configura-
              tion file.  By default, this is either the value of
              the  --cc  option  (above),  the  value  of  the CON-
              TOOL_FILTERS environment variable,  or  ~/.contool.
              This text field provides file name completion, like
              _c_s_h(1), by typing a space or carriage return.

              After determining which components to be read  from
              the file, and the name of the file, clicking on the
              LLooaadd button will cause the desired elements  to  be
              read  from  the  file.   If filters are loaded, any
              existing filters are discarded.  If _c_o_n_t_o_o_l was  in
              the  middle of filtering a multi-line message, that
              filtering action is terminated.

              _C_o_n_t_o_o_l can read files created by all previous ver-
              sions  of _c_o_n_t_o_o_l.  Files written by _c_o_n_t_o_o_l cannot
              be read by any previous version.

CONTOOL(1)                                             CONTOOL(1)


       FFiillee:: SSaavvee CCoonnffiigguurraattiioonn......
              is analogous to the LLooaadd  CCoonnffiigguurraattiioonn  operation,
              bringing up a dialog box containing a non-exclusive
              setting, a text field, and a SSaavvee button.   In  the
              same  manner  as the LLooaadd CCoonnffiigguurraattiioonn dialog, the
              user indiactes which  items  he  desires  to  save,
              specifies  the  destination file, and clicks on the
              SSaavvee button to save the information.

              _C_o_n_t_o_o_l writes the data in  a  format  incompatible
              with  previous versions (release 3.0 or earlier) of
              the tool.

       FFiillee:: SSttaarrtt LLooggggiinngg
              starts logging console messages  to  the  log  file
              specified  by the tool properties, or the --LL option
              (above).   The  tool  properties  also  contains  a
              switch  which determines whether messages are writ-
              ten before or after filtering occurs.   If  before,
              all  messages  are  logged.  If after, a message is
              written to the log if it does not  match  a  filter
              and  the  default action in the tool properties has
              "Log message" enabled; or if it  matches  a  filter
              with  both  the "Save" and "Log message" attributes
              set.

              The log file is written in such a manner that  mul-
              tiple  invocations of _c_o_n_t_o_o_l can write to the same
              log file without conflict.  New messages are always
              appended  to  the  log  file.   Log  files  can  be
              forcibly flushed with a SIGHUP; see SIGNALS, below.

       FFiillee:: SSttoopp LLooggggiinngg
              stops the logging process.

       FFiillee:: PPrriinntt
              uses the "Print Filter" specified in the tool prop-
              erties to print the contents of the console.   Only
              messages saved in the console can be printed.

       FFiillee:: AAbboouutt CCoonnttooooll......
              provides  a  brief  history  of _c_o_n_t_o_o_l, and allows
              users to send e-mail to the contool developer.

       VViieeww:: AArrcchhiivvee......
              opens the message archive dialog box.  This  dialog
              box displays a scrolling window containing all mes-
              sages archived from the main console display.   See
              MESSAGE ARCHIVE, below.

       VViieeww:: AArrcchhiivvee MMeessssaaggeess
              moves  all  the  messages in the console display to
              the message archive.  This is a handy way to remove
              already  viewed  messages  from the console without

              losing them for later review.  By periodically mov-
              ing  messages  to the archive, only the most recent
              messages will be visible in the main  console  dis-
              play.   Messages  can  be archived automatically as
              well; see TOOL PROPERTIES, below.

       VViieeww:: BBeeccoommee CCoonnssoollee
              ensures  that  _c_o_n_t_o_o_l  has  the   system   console
              attribute.  SunOS allows exactly one process in the
              system to own the console.  If some  other  process
              takes control of the console, the user can reassign
              the console attribute to _c_o_n_t_o_o_l  using  this  menu
              selection.

       VViieeww:: CClleeaarr MMeessssaaggeess
              clears  all messages from the console text display.

       VViieeww:: RReesseett FFiilltteerr
              interrupts filtering of a  multi-line  filter.   If
              the user incorrectly specifies the end pattern of a
              multi-line filter, _c_o_n_t_o_o_l may never stop  process-
              ing the filter, causing all subsequent console mes-
              sages to be incorrectly  handled.   This  selection
              resets the effect of any multi-line filter that may
              be in effect.

              When processing a multi-line filter,  _c_o_n_t_o_o_l  dis-
              plays  the starting filter pattern in the left win-
              dow footer.  If the left footer is  blank,  _c_o_n_t_o_o_l
              is not processing a multi-line filter.

EEDDIITTIINNGG FFIILLTTEERRSS
       The  FFiilltteerrss  dialog  presents a scrolling list of filters
       and a variety of devices used to modify the current filter
       set.  The items in this dialog are:

       FFiilltteerrss
              This  scrolling  list shows the starting pattern of
              each filter currently used by _c_o_n_t_o_o_l.  The pattern
              text  is  preceded  by  a  small  glyph  indicating
              whether the filter is a single-line  or  multi-line
              filter.

              If  exactly  one  item in the list is selected, the
              properties of that filter will be displayed in  the

              selected, the remainder of the dialog box is grayed
              out.

       IInnsseerrtt This  button  inserts  a  new blank filter into the
              scrolling list, allowing the user to add  new  fil-
              ters  to  the  filter  set.  A menu attached to the
              button allows the user to select the insert  point:
              at  the  top of the list, before the current selec-
              tion, after the current selection, or at the bottom
              of  the list.  The "before" and "after" choices are
              only enabled if exactly one filter in the  list  is
              selected.   The  default  position is the bottom of
              the list.

       EEddiitt   This button edits the currently selected filters in
              the  list.   The  menu  attached to this button has
              four choices: CCuutt, CCooppyy, PPaassttee, and DDeelleettee.

              The CCuutt operation removes the selected filters from
              the  list  and  places them on the clipboard, where
              they can subsequently be pasted back into the list.

              The  CCooppyy  operation copies the selected filters to
              the clipboard.  The filters are  not  removed  from
              the  list.   The copied filters can subsequently be
              pasted back into the list.

              The PPaassttee operation copies filters from  the  clip-
              board  into  the  list.   This selection has a menu
              which specifies the paste position: at the  top  of
              the  list,  before the current selection, after the
              current selection, or at the bottom  of  the  list.
              The  "before"  and "after" choices are only enabled
              if exactly one filter in the list is selected.  The
              default position is the bottom of the list.

              The  DDeelleettee  operation removes the selected filters
              from the list without placing  them  on  the  clip-
              board.   Once  deleted, filters cannot be recovered
              with a paste operation.

              The CCuutt, CCooppyy, and DDeelleettee selections are only  pre-
              sented  if  one  or  more  filters  in the list are
              selected.  The PPaassttee selection  is  only  available
              after a CCuutt or CCooppyy operation.

       UUppddaattee This  button  updates the currently selected filter
              using the values presented in the remainder of  the
              dialog  box.   This  button  is  only accessible if
              exactly one filter in the list is selected.

              UUppddaattee is used to modify an existing filter.   When
              just  that  filter  is selected, its attributes are
              placed into the  other  dialog  elements  described

              user clicks the UUppddaattee button to apply the  changes
              to the currently selected filter.

              In  a  similar  manner,  UUppddaattee  is  used  to apply
              attributes to a new, blank  filter  placed  in  the
              list via the IInnsseerrtt button.

       TTyyppee   The  TTyyppee  toggle  indicates  whether a filter will
              match just a single line message, or will  match  a
              multiple  line  message.  When "Single line filter"
              is chosen, the EEnndd ppaatttteerrnn item  is  disabled,  and
              the  user must specify the pattern which will match
              a single line of text written to the console.  When
              "Multi-line  filter"  is  selected, the EEnndd ppaatttteerrnn
              item is enabled, and the user needs to specify both
              a starting and an ending pattern.  All text follow-
              ing a line which matches the starting  pattern,  up
              to  and  including  a line which matches the ending
              pattern, is considered to be part of  the  filtered
              message.

       PPaatttteerrnn
              This  text  field  specifies the regular expression
              which matches the first (and, in the case of single
              line  filters,  the  only) line of text in the fil-
              tered message.  Any  valid  regular  expression  is
              permitted.   Users  that  are  trying to match some
              text exactly should be aware that  regular  expres-
              sions  can  match text anywhere in a line, and that
              the expression should be anchored to the start  (or
              end)  of  the  line  by  using  the  "^"  (or  "$")
              metacharacters.  For more  information  on  regular
              expressions, see _e_d(1).

              As a special extension to regular expressions, _c_o_n_-
              _t_o_o_l recognizes a backslash ("\") followed  by  one
              or  more  octal digits as a single character in the
              expression.  This allows  non-printing  characters,
              such  as  control characters, to be inserted in the
              text pattern.  If a backslash is  followed  by  any
              other character, it is placed in the pattern verba-
              tim.  Thus, to create an expression which matches a
              control-G  followed  by  a  backslash,  the pattern
              "\007\" would suffice.

       EEnndd ppaatttteerrnn
              If the TTyyppee is set  to  "Multi-line  filter",  this
              field  must  contain  the  regular expression which
              matches the last line of the block of text  handled
              by this filter.

              field sets a limit on how long _c_o_n_t_o_o_l will process
              the  filter.   This prevents filters with erroneous
              end patterns from absorbing all console output once
              they  begin filtering.  The default value, 0, indi-
              cates that no timeout is in effect.

       CCoommmmeenntt
              This text field contains any comments regarding the
              filter  the user wishes to record.  Since some fil-
              ters can be rather arcane,  it  is  suggested  that
              users comment their filters.

       WWhheenn mmaattcchheedd
              This  exclusive  setting  dictates  the behavior of
              _c_o_n_t_o_o_l when a filter is matched.   If  "Save  mes-
              sage"  is  chosen,  the  message is copied into the
              console display, and various actions can be  taken.
              If "Ignore message" is selected, the filter text is
              discarded and no further actions are taken by  _c_o_n_-
              _t_o_o_l.

       WWhheenn ssaavveedd
              If WWhheenn mmaattcchheedd is set to "Save message", this non-
              exclusive choice item will be enabled, allowing the
              user  to  specify  what contool should do with this
              message.

              The "Beep" choice causes the terminal  bell  to  be
              sounded.   If  selected,  the  beep  counter to the
              right of this item is enabled, allowing the user to
              choose anywhere from one brief beep up to 99 annoy-
              ing beeps.

              The "Command" choice causes a single command to  be
              executed.  The text field to the right of this item
              must contain the command to be  executed.   _C_o_n_t_o_o_l
              will  write the text of the message to the standard
              input of the command.  For example, using "mail  -s
              'Contool  output'  user"  as the command would mail
              the message text to the _u_s_e_r.

              The "Flash icon" choice causes the _c_o_n_t_o_o_l icon  to
              flash,  alternating between the "Check console" and
              "Flash" icons.

              The "Log message" choice causes the message  to  be
              written  to  the message log, if logging is enabled
              and is performed after filtering.

              The "Open window" choice  causes  _c_o_n_t_o_o_l  to  open
              from  its iconic state, and to move in front of any
              obscuring windows.

              The "Timestamp" choice causes _c_o_n_t_o_o_l  to  write  a

              into the console.  The timestamp is written in con-
              junction with the timestamp resolution specified in

              Until this button is clicked, all changes  made  to
              the  filters are not used by _c_o_n_t_o_o_l.  After click-
              ing AAcccceepptt, the changed filters become the  current
              working set.

              Note  that even after clicking AAcccceepptt, the configu-
              ration file is not updated.  To  make  the  changes

              This button makes the filters in the scrolling list
              the current set of active filters and writes  those
              filters and the tool properties to the current con-
              figuration file.  To write the filters to a differ-
              ent  file, or to write just the filters without the
              tool properties, press the AAppppllyy button and use the
              SSaavvee CCoonnffiigguurraattiioonn dialog instead.

       RReesseett  This  button  discards any changes made to the cur-

       The  TTooooll  PPrrooppeerrttiieess dialog allows the user to change the
       default behavior of _c_o_n_t_o_o_l.  This includes  various  tool
       attributes,  and  the actions taken when a message arrives
       which does not match any filter.  The  various  properties
       include:

              taken by _c_o_n_t_o_o_l when a message arrives which  does
              not  match any filter.  The various choices in this
              setting exactly correspond to the WWhheenn  ssaavveedd  set-

       AArrcchhiivvee mmeessssaaggeess
              This exclusive setting determines how messages will
              be moved from the main console display to the  mes-
              sage  archive.  If set to "Manually", messages will
              only be archived when the user selects AArrcchhiivvee MMeess--
              ssaaggeess  from  the VViieeww menu in the main _c_o_n_t_o_o_l win-
              dow.  If set to "When  closing  contool",  messages
              are copied to the archive whenever the _c_o_n_t_o_o_l win-
              dow is closed.  This mode assumes  that  you  typi-
              cally  open  _c_o_n_t_o_o_l,  read  all  the messages, and
              close the window.  Each time you open  the  window,
              you'll  only  see  messages that have arrived since
              you last closed _c_o_n_t_o_o_l.

              Archived messages can  be  viewed  in  the  message

       PPrriinntt ffiilltteerr
              This text field specifies the command to be used to
              print the console.  The default  is  "lpr".   Local
              site  dependencies may require a different command.

       ""AAllll iiss wweellll"" iiccoonn
              This text field contains the  path  of  a  file  in
              either  icon  or XBM format.  Icon-format files may
              be created with _i_c_o_n_e_d_i_t(1); XBM-format  files  are
              created with a number of tools.  If the path is not
              absolute, the value of  the  ICON_PATH  environment
              variable  will be used to find the file.  ICON_PATH
              should contain a list of directories, separated  by
              colons.   The  contained image will be used as _c_o_n_-
              _t_o_o_l's regular icon image.  This image is displayed
              whenever no flashing is in effect.

              either icon or XBM  format.   The  contained  image
              will  be  used to mask _c_o_n_t_o_o_l's "All is well" icon
              image when _c_o_n_t_o_o_l  is  run  on  a  color  desktop.

              This numeric field specifies the minimum number  of
              seconds  to  wait before writing a new timestamp to
              the console.  Messages which  require  timestamping
              will  only write a timestamp if this number of sec-
              onds have transpired since the last timestamp.

       MMaaxxiimmuumm mmeessssaaggee tteexxtt

              bytes,  of messages that will be stored in the con-
              sole.  When writing a message to the console  would

              to remove to make room.  _C_o_n_t_o_o_l  will  attempt  to
              remove whole messages within the constraints of the

              used   by  _c_o_n_t_o_o_l.   After  clicking  AAcccceepptt,  the

       The  MMeessssaaggee  AArrcchhiivvee  dialog  allows  the  user  to  view
       archived messages.  The dialog presents a  scrolling  text
       window and two buttons.

       CClleeaarr  The  CClleeaarr button removes all the messages from the
              archive.  Normally, the archive works like the main
              _c_o_n_t_o_o_l  display:  it  retains  a certain amount of
              text, and deletes the oldest messages as  new  mes-

              clears the archive display.

              The  archive  window will hold ten times the amount
              of text specified for the main console display,  as

       Previous versions of _c_o_n_t_o_o_l relied on  the  user  editing
       the  configuration file by hand.  This version manages the
       file automatically, and it is not intended that  the  file
       be  edited directly by users.  See EDITING FILTERS, above,
       for information on modifying the behavior of _c_o_n_t_o_o_l.

       _C_o_n_t_o_o_l uses certain environment variables to control  its
       behavior.  They are:

       CCOONNTTOOOOLL__FFIILLTTEERRSS
              specifies  the  file  from  which _c_o_n_t_o_o_l reads its
              filters and properties.  If not defined, ~/.contool
              is  used.  If --cc is specified, it overrides the use
              of CONTOOL_FILTERS.

       CCOONNTTOOOOLL__LLAABBEELL
              specifies the label to be placed in _c_o_n_t_o_o_l's  main
              window.   The  default  label  contains the current
              release number of _c_o_n_t_o_o_l.

       CCOONNTTOOOOLL__LLOOGGNNAAMMEE
              specifies the name to be prefixed to  each  message
              written  to the console log file.  If this variable
              is not defined, the machine's hostname is used.

       IICCOONN__PPAATTHH
              contains  a  colon-separated  list  of  directories
              which  _c_o_n_t_o_o_l  will  search to find the icon files

              specified in various tool properties.

SSIIGGNNAALLSS
       _C_o_n_t_o_o_l will respond to certain Unix signals.  They are:

       SSIIGGHHUUPP Upon receipt of  SIGHUP,  _c_o_n_t_o_o_l  will  close  and
              reopen  its  log file, if logging is enabled.  This
              guarantees that  logged  messages  are  flushed  to
              disk.

       SSIIGGUUSSRR11
              Upon receipt of SIGUSR1, _c_o_n_t_o_o_l will stop blinking
              its icon.  This is a handy  way  to  stop  blinking
              without opening _c_o_n_t_o_o_l.

BBUUGGSS
       _C_o_n_t_o_o_l  is  a view-only tool, and there is no way to type
       commands on the console.

       Window system bugs may cause unusual, but harmless, quirks
       in  the  behavior of _c_o_n_t_o_o_l.  In particular, displaying a
       menu in a dialog box without actually  selecting  an  item
       from that menu may cause the dialog box to close.
