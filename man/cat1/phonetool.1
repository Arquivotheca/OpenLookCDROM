       pphhoonneettooooll is an OpenLook style application that was origi-
       nally  created to run under Sun's OpenWindows environment.
       It is written in XView, and its code skeleton was  created
       using Sun's DevGuide product.

       pphhoonneettooooll is a simple message-sending tool.  It does noth-
       ing that regular email won't do, but  it  is  designed  to
       reduce  the typing involved when intercepting a call for a
       fellow worker who's  not  at  his/her  desk.   Users  keep
       pphhoonneettooooll  iconified  on  their desktop, and simply pop it
       open and fill in a name  and  a  phone  number  when  they
       intercept a call for a co-worker.

       Use any OpenLook window options with this tool.

UUSSAAGGEE
       The  pphhoonneettooooll application is about the same size as those
       little pink or yellow slips of paper your secertary leaves
       on  your desk with phone messages on it (about 4" x 5 1/4"
       here in the U.S... I'm not  sure  what  various  Europeans
       use...).  At the top of the pphhoonneettooooll pane is a "To:" text
       field with a "login id's" menu button to the right of  it.
       Users  can  type  in  any  valid email address in the text
       field that is  under  80  characters.   Invalid  addresses
       result  in  mail  being returned to the sender.  For effi-
       ciency, users can select a name from the "login id's" menu
       instead,  and  that  name  will  appear  in the "To:" text
       field.

       The "login id's" menu is compiled directly from the _._p_h_o_n_-
       _e_r_c  file.   Users must have a _._p_h_o_n_e_r_c file in their home
       directory.  The _._p_h_o_n_e_r_c file  contains  the  login  name,
       email  address, or email alias of co-workers for whom they
       might intercept phone calls.  The file  may  contain  com-
       ments  on lines beginning with a pound (#) sign.  Only one
       login name, email address, or email alias is  allowed  per
       line in the file.

       Below  the  "To:"  text  field are three more text fields,
       "Caller:", "Company:", and  "Phone:".   Users  fill  these
       text  fields  in  with the relevant information while they
       are taking the message on the phone.  Below  these  fields
       are six checkbox items with "canned" messages next to them
       that  users  may  select  from.   Or,  if  elaboration  is

       required,  below  the  checkboxes is an "Other:" scrolling
       text pane in which users can enter a longer message.

       At the bottom  is  a  "Send  Message"  button  that,  when
       pressed, mails the message off to the email address speci-
       fied at the top and then clears the form for the next mes-
       sage.   There is also a "Clear" button at the bottom which
       blanks out all the fields, checkboxes,  and  text  if  the
       user  decides  not  to  take  a message he/she has already
       started.

NNOOTTEESS
       pphhoonneettooooll should run under any X-based window manager.  It
       will not, however, run under a kernel-based windowing sys-
       tem, such as SunView.  Users must also have a  copy  of  a
       _._p_h_o_n_e_r_c file to build the "login id's" menu.  If the user
       doesn't wish to have anything in that menu,  the  _._p_h_o_n_e_r_c
       file  may still be present, only it must be empty.  Or the
       user may forgo having a _._p_h_o_n_e_r_c file at all.  The  _._p_h_o_n_-
       _e_r_c file must be in the home directory.  The _._p_h_o_n_e_r_c file
       contains the login name, email address, or email alias  of
       co-workers for whom they might intercept phone calls.  The
       file may contain comments on lines beginning with a  pound
       (#)  sign.   Only  one login name, email address, or email
       alias is allowed per line in the file.


BBUUGGSS
       pphhoonneettooooll may not run on machines other than Sun's without
       font problems.

       The  scrollbar  on  the  scrolling  text pane sometimes is
       drawn incorrectly, and the bottom anchor does not  appear.
       It is still usable.
