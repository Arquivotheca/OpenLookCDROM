       xvtdl - A To Do List Manager Using the XView Toolkit

       xxvvttddll  is  a  "to do" list manager that features multiple,
       hierarchical to do lists with items that propagate through
       time (when not "checked off") and items that can be recur-
       ring in various time/calendar increments.   Items that are
       "checked  off"  can  either  be  retained for posterity or
       deleted by the propagation mechanism.  The  set  of  lists
       are indicated by category names; categories can be hierar-
       chical to form trees  of  categories.   Deadlines  can  be
       specified for any item, with actions that are performed on
       the deadline or after it has  past.   Multi-level  logging
       allows  items  to  be logged in several modes when checked
       off  or  on.   Lists  can  be  printed  to  "regular"  and
       PostScript  printers.  In normal use, xxvvttddll can be started
       with the window system and left  running  (usually  in  an
       iconic  state),  as it uses very little CPU time and auto-
       matically propagates items at midnight every night.

       xxvvttddll uses the XView  toolkit  from  Sun  Microsystems  to
       implement the OPEN LOOK graphical user interface.

       Unless  otherwise directed by the "-f" option, xxvvttddll main-
       tains a database of to do list items in the  $HOME/.tododb
       file.   This database is in ASCII format and is written at
       various times throughout  its  execution  lifespan  (e.g.,
       whenever  items are propagated or when new items are added
       to a list).

       xxvvttddll keeps track of the modifcation times  of  databases.
       When  its  internal  modification  time  differs  from the
       database file's modification  times,  it  will  sense  the
       decrepency and ask the use how to handle it.  The user can
       merge any changes made, write our the  current,  in-memory
       copy  of  the  database (making the user's copy the actual
       copy), or ignore the changes altogether.  _N_o_t_e _t_h_a_t  _m_e_r_g_-

       were deleted in the "altered" database file will still  be
       maintained  in  the current, in-memory version _a_n_d _w_r_i_t_t_e_n

UUSSIINNGG XXVVTTDDLL
       When  xxvvttddll  is started, the todo list for the first cate-
       gory for the current date is displayed.  There  are  three
       areas  that will recognize events.  These are the calendar
       area on the upper left, the control area above the  to  do
       list, and the to do list itself.

       The calendar area will respond to any mouse click.  Click-
       ing in the calendar will move the current list to the date
       clicked  on.   The  date  for which the todo list is being
       displayed will appear in the calendar with  a  box  around
       it.   A  full text date specification will be given to the
       right of the calendar.  If the mouse click  is  not  on  a
       number,  xxvvttddll tries to deduce what date would be there if
       the previous or next months numbers were displayed.

       The list itself displays todo list items and their priori-
       ties.   The  middle  mouse button has no effect here.  The
       left mouse button will select or deselect items -- for use
       with  editing operations -- with a single click.  A double
       click on an item will toggle its "checked" state  --  from
       off to on or from on to off.  Checked items are not propa-
       gated and items are optionally logged when checked on  and
       off.   The right (menu) mouse button will display the edit
       menu -- the same menu as connected with the "Edit"  button
       in  the  control  area (see below).  Some keyboard actions
       have effect here:

              COPY (L6), PASTE (L8), and CUT (L10)  keys  perform
              the  same  copy, paste, and cut operations (respec-
              tively) that can be initiated from  the  edit  menu
              (see below).

              Up-arrow  (R8)  and  Down-arrow (R14) keys increase
              and decrease priority (respectively) for a selected
              list item, just as selecting the appropriate opera-
              tion from the edit menu does (see below).

       The control area above the list  has  the  following  con-
       trols:

              Left and Right arrow buttons:
                     These  move incrementally through the calen-
                     dar.  Left moves back in time;  right  moves
                     forward  in  time.   Without  any other keys
                     down, the effect is to move one day backward
                     or  forward.  With the control key down, the
                     increment is one week.  With the  shift  key
                     pressed,  the  increment is one month.  With
                     the Meta key  down,  the  increment  is  one
                     year.

              Category Menu:
                     This  is  a menu (bring it up with the right

                     that particular list.

              The "Create" button:
                     This button is a menu button that allows the
                     user to create new list items or categories.
                     Each  choice  brings up its own window.  See

                                    can be changed and the "Done"
                                    button  will refresh the item

                     This  is  a  menu button that allows special
                     listing operations.  Note that  this  button
                     will  change its label, depending on how the
                     default listing action on the button's  menu
                     changes.   For  all items except "List Cate-
                     gory", the button label will change to "List
                     Cat"  to allow easy redisplay of the current
                     category.   For  the  "List  Category"  menu
                     choice, the label will revert to "List All".
                     Also, selecting an  option  that  redisplays
                     the  todo  list  will  revert  the button to
                     "List All" status.

                     The operations are as follows:
                             List All
                                    This causes xxvvttddll to  display
                                    all list items from all cate-
                                    gories in the  user-specified
                                    order on the todo list.  When
                                    this list  is  displayed,  it
                                    can be manipulated as a "nor-
                                    mal" list  from  a  category.
                                    Items  may be checked off and
                                    on -- the effect of this will
                                    be  reflected in the category

                     This  button  is a menu button allowing cer-

       Creating  and editing items is done through the entry win-

       entry  is chosen from the "Create" menu button or the edit
       menu item is selected.  This window is detailed below.

              Category Menu:
                     This menu, only active for  list  item  cre-

                     placed into.

                     This  is  the  actual text of the to do list
                     item.

              The "Priority:" slider:
                     This slider specifies the priority  of  item
                     being  created/edited.   This  will  allow a
                     priority to be specified between 1 and 9.

              The "Recurring..." button:
                     This will  pop  up  the  recurrence  editor,
                     detailed  below.   This window lets the user
                     specify the  recurrence  properties  of  the
                     item being created or edited.

              The "Deadline..." button:
                     This button will popup the deadline specifi-
                     cation  window.   This  window  is  detailed
                     below;   it   allows  the  specification  of
                     actions to occur when a deadline for an item
                     is encountered.

              The "Cancel" and "Done" buttons:
                     "Cancel"  cancels  the  creation  or editing
                     operation, ignoring the settings in the win-
                     dow.  "Done" completes the creation or edit-
                     ing operation, installing the changes.  Both
                     choices close the editing window.

       "Daily".)  Most is self-explanatory.  Choosing  "Done"  in
       the recurrence window will install the recurrence propoer-
       ties specified; choosing "Cancel" will ignore  the  recur-
       rence choices.

       The  specification  of "days of the week" is more flexible
       now than at version prior to 4.x.  Here, you  can  specify
       any day of the week -- and mix and match them.  TThheerree iiss aa
       pprroobblleemm hheerree,, however, with prior versions of xxvvttddll..   The
       days  of  the week are stored in a "bitwise" form -- 1 for
       Monday, 2 for Tuesday, 3 for _b_o_t_h Monday and Tuesday, etc.
       This means that Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday in
       the old version will  come  out  as  Monday/Tuesday,  Mon-
       day/Wednesday,       Tuesday/Wednesday,      and      Mon-
       day/Tuesday/Wednesday, respectively.   Please  check  your
       "day of the week" specifications when starting to use ver-
       sion 5.0 for the first time.

       Note that -- for monthly specification -- "week of  month"
       and  "day  of  month"  are  mutually  exclusive.   This is
       arranged in xxvvttddll by inactivating "day of month"  whenever
       "week of month" is specified.

       Note  also  that  for  "number  of  weeks"  and "number of
       months", a zero (0) is considered "forever".

       A deadline is a date on or after which certain actions may
       occur.   A deadline may be absolute or relative.  Absolute
       deadlines  are  given  in   "mm/dd/yy"   notation   (e.g.,
       "7/8/92").   Relative  deadlines are given relative to the
       starting date of the list item (note that's _n_o_t  the  cur-
       rent  date -- especially if the item has been propagated).
       Relative deadlines are give as

              <number><units>

       <number> may be positive or negative.  <units> must be one
       of  "d", "w", "m", or "y", indicating days, weeks, months,
       or years, respectively.  For  example,  "4d"  indicates  4
       days  from the starting date fo the item; "3m" specifies 3
       months from the date of the item.

       While absolute deadlines work fine for most  applications,
       relative  deadlines  are  the  best  to use with recurring
       items, when the starting date of the item depends  on  its
       recurring properties.

       Deadlines  are  examined  _a_t _p_r_o_p_a_g_a_t_i_o_n _t_i_m_e_, and only at
       propagation time.  (Propagation occurs when  the  tool  is
       started and at or around midnight each night.)

       Actions  can  be taken at or after a deadline date.  These
       are specified in the deadline window and may be  combined.
       A new deadline window is initialized to the actions speci-

                     number of time units after the deadline have
                     past, the item will be deleted.
              + Priority
                     For each day after the  deadline  has  past,
                     the  item's  priority will be incremented by
                     the amount specified.
              - Priority
                     For each day after the  deadline  has  past,
                     the  item's  priority will be decremented by
                     the amount specified.

                     A message will be sent to the address speci-

                     occurs.

       Categories  are  created  and  edited through the category
       editor window.  This window is used to insert  a  category
       anywhere  in  the category tree.  There are a few rules to
       follow: (1) a category cannot be placed as the subcategory
       of one that already has subcategories, (2) a category can-
       not be named with the same name as any other category, and
       (3)  a  category  cannot  be  placed  as  a subcategory to
       itself.

       The controls on the editor window are self-explanatory.

       Invoking  the  "Properties..."  item in the edit menu will
       open the properties window.  This window  controls  the  X
       resources  used to control xxvvttddll and will create and main-
       tain a file in the user's home directory that contains the
       resource  specifications.   This  file, called ".xvtdlrc",
       will be automatically  updated  when  the  properties  are
       updated.   There are three control items and four property

                     lines", "Logging", and "Other  Info".   Each
                     is selectable through the menu on the "Cate-

                     next time the program is invoked.

       The property items in each property sheet are detailed  as
       follows:
              The "Sorting" Sheet:
                     The Sort Order Choices:
                             Sorting may be specified as a combi-
                             nation of  priority,  chronological,
                             and  alphabetical orders.  These are
                             specified in  "sort  levels".   Sort
                             level  3 is done within items sorted
                             by  sort  level  2,  which  is  done
                             within   items  sorted  within  sort
                             level 1.

                             Note that no levels may be specified
                             further  if  alphabetical  order  is
                             selected.  Thus, alphabetical  order
                             is  always the last order specified.

                     Priority Preference:
                             This provides  a  way  to  customize
                             what  order  the user wishes priori-
                             ties to be listed: either with  high

                             = 1 down to low = 9 or with high = 9
                             and low = 1.  The default  situation
                             is the latter.

                     Chronology Preference:
                             This  provides  a  way  to customize
                             what order the user wishes  item  to
                             be  listed  chronologically:  either
                             oldest first or newest  first.   The
                             default situation is the latter.

              The "Printing" Sheet:
                     Default Printer:
                             This  is  the printer that will come
                             up as the default in the print  win-
                             dow.   It  is specified here because
                             changing the printer  in  the  print
                             window  does  not  manipulate  the X
                             resource.  If this resource is  left
                             empty, then xxvvttddll will use the value
                             of the PRINTER environment variable.

                     Default Printer Mode:
                             This  is the printer mode (normal or
                             PostScript) that will come up as the
                             default  in the print window.  It is
                             specified here because changing  the
                             printer in the print window does not
                             manipulate the X resource.

              The "Deadlines" Sheet:
                     This sheet is  a  replica  of  the  deadline
                     specification  window, except that the dead-
                     line date is not present.  Any  setting  the
                     user makes on this sheet will be used as the
                     default setting for the items on  new  dead-
                     line specifications for list items.

              The "Logging" Sheet:
                     Log Preference:
                             This specifies when to log an entry.
                             Choices are  "When  Checked",  which
                             allow   logging  when  the  item  is
                             checked    on    or     off,     "At
                             Quit/Propagation",   which   logs  a
                             checked off item  when  the  program
                             propagates  at  midnight or the pro-
                             gram  is  terminated,  or   "Never",
                             which disables logging.

                     Log Info:
                             This  specifies the kind of informa-
                             tion to occur in the log file.  This
                             can   be  either  "Timestamp  Only",

                             item string in the file without user
                             intervention, or  "User  Specified",
                             which constructs a minimal log entry
                             and starts an editor containing that
                             entry  that the user can use to cus-
                             tomize it.  This editor window  con-
                             tains  an editor window and two but-
                             tons:  "Cancel"  will   cancel   any
                             edits,  entering  the  original  log
                             entry in the log  file,  and  "Done"
                             will  save  any edits made, entering
                             the new version in the log file.

                     Log Filename:
                             This gives the name of the log file.
                             This  is  can be a relative or abso-
                             lute filename.

              The "Other Info" Sheet:
                     Default Priority:
                             This  specification  will  set   the
                             default  priority that sets the pri-
                             ority of newly created  list  items.
                             The default for this setting is 5.
                     On Propagation
                             This  specifier will direct the pro-

                             list  items when it moves items to a
                             new day.  The user can  either  have
                             them  deleted, which is the default,
                             or have them retained.

                             NNoottee that if a retained, checked-off
                             item  is  unchecked,  it immediately
                             propagates to the current day.
                     Foreground Color and Background Color
                             These allow the  textual  specifica-
                             tion  of  the  foreground  and back-

                             to  each  textual  line,   a   color
                             chooser  will be invoked that allows
                             you to choose a color with the mouse
                             and  will  enter  the  name  of that
                             color on the property window line.

                             Naturally, these items are  inactive

       quotes in list items.

       Category specifications are given as

              category: ''category name''

       All  entries  up to the next category specification or the
       end of file designate todo  list  items  in  the  category
       listed.

       Parent  specifications  can  be  given  for categories and
       always appear  after  the  category  specification.   They
       indicate  the  name of the parent of the current category.
       Parent specifications are given as

              parent: ''parent name''


       To do list items are given in the form

              date[|recurring-part]:priority:''list item text''

       The "date" is given in  mm/dd/yy  format.   The  recurring
       part  is  optional and is specified by a string of charac-
       ters:

              one of "d", "w",  "b",  "m",  or  "y"  to  indicate
              daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, or yearly repiti-
              tion.

              if weekly or biweekly, this is followed by an inte-
              ger.  The  integer  is viewed as a 7-bit bitstring,
              where the bit is on when the event occurs on a spe-
              cific  day  of the week (0 = Sunday) _(_N_o_t_e _t_h_a_t _t_h_e

              if  weekly  or  biweekly, this is followed by a "W"
              and a number, indicating the number of  weeks  this
              item is to repeat

              if  monthly,  a "N" and a number is concatenated to
              indication the week number in the month  to  repeat
              the item

       The priority part is an integer from 1-9.

       Deadline specifications give deadlines associated with the
       most recently defined list item.  Their format is given by

       all  on one line.  "date" is given in absolute or relative
       deadline form.  "actions" is the value of the action spec-
       ification  item  on the deadline specification window -- a
       bitstring with bits on or off depending if that particular
       action  is  specified.   "deletetime"  and  "movetime" are
       integers, giving the number of the  respective  units  for
       delete  time and move time.  "deleteunits" and "moveunits"
       are integers in the range 0-3, giving days, weeks,  month,
       and  years, respectively.  "+units" and "-units" are inte-
       gers giving the number of priority steps to  increment  or
       decrement  an  item.   "on  addr" and "after addr" are the
       addresses to send messages about the deadline occuring  or
       being past, respectively.

       There  are  many resources that  the resource database for
       xxvvttddll can contain.  They are included here  for  complete-
       ness;  however,  they  can  all be manipulated through the
       properties window.  They are


       SortOrder
              a sequence of three digits indicating the  criteria
              to  be  used  at  a sort level.  Values 0 through 2
              indicate priority, chronilogical, and  alphabetical
              criteria,  respectively.  A value of 3 indicates no
              criteria.  The sequence is ordered sort level 1  to
              sort level 3 by left to right.

       PriorityListing
              a string resource that can be either "ascending" or

              a string resource that can be either "ascending" or
              "descending", indicating which  direction,  new  to
              old, the chronilogical order is given.

       PrintDestination
              a  string  resource, values of "file" or "printer",
              indicating the default destination to which an out-
              put of the todo list should go.

       Printer
              a string which specifies the default printer to use
              in the print window

       PrintFile
              a  string resource indicating the default file name
              into which an output of the todo list should go  if
              the destination is "file".

       Logging
              a  boolean  resource specifying whether to log list
              item activity

       LogPreference
              a string resource  that  can  contain  two  values:
              "atchecked"  indicates  that  logging  should occur
              when an item is checked off or on,  "atquit"  indi-
              cates  that  logging should occur at propagation or
              termination of the program

       LogInfoPreference
              a string resource that can contain one of two  val-
              ues:  "timestamp"  indicates only timestamps are to
              be logged in the  log  file,  "userspec"  indicates
              that the user is to specify the contents of the log
              entry

       LogFileName
              a string resource giving the name of the log file

       There  are  currently no known aspects of the program that
       corrupt the data or crash the program.

       There are some annoying bugs.  When the database is large,
       merging  in  changes  made  by someone else duplicates all
       entries.
