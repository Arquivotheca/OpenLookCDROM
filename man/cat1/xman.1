       _X_m_a_n is a manual page browser.  The default  size  of  the
       initial _x_m_a_n window is small so that you can leave it run-
       ning throughout your entire login session.  In the initial
       window  there are three options: _H_e_l_p will pop up a window
       with on-line help, _Q_u_i_t will exit, and  _M_a_n_u_a_l  _P_a_g_e  will
       pop up a window with a manual page browser in it.  You may
       pop up more than one manual page  browser  window  from  a
       single execution of _x_m_a_n.

       For  further information on using _x_m_a_n please read the on-
       line help information.  The rest of this manual page  will
       discuss customization of _x_m_a_n.

       _X_m_a_n  allows  customization  of both the directories to be
       searched for manual pages, and the name that  each  direc-
       tory  will  map  to in the _S_e_c_t_i_o_n_s menu.  Xman determines
       which directories it will search by  reading  the  _M_A_N_P_A_T_H
       environment  variable.   If  no  _M_A_N_P_A_T_H is found then the
       directory is /usr/man is searched on POSIX systems.   This
       environment  is  expected  to be a colon-separated list of
       directories for xman to search.

       setenv MANPATH /mit/kit/man:/usr/man

       By default, _x_m_a_n will search each of the following  direc-
       tories  (in each of the directories specified in the users
       MANPATH) for manual pages.  If manual pages exist in  that
       directory  then they are added to list of manual pages for
       the corresponding menu item.  A menu  item  is  only  dis-
       played  for  those  sections  that actually contain manual
       pages.

XMAN(1)                                                   XMAN(1)


       mano           (o) Old

       For instance, a user has three directories in  her  manual
       path  and each contain a directory called _m_a_n_3.  All these
       manual pages will appear alphabetically  sorted  when  the
       user  selects  the  menu  item called _(_3_) _S_u_b_r_o_u_t_i_n_e_s.  If
       there is no directory called _m_a_n_o in any of  the  directo-
       ries  in  her MANPATH, or there are no manual pages in any
       of the directories called _m_a_n_o then no menu item  will  be
       displayed for the section called _(_o_) _O_l_d.


       By using the _m_a_n_d_e_s_c file a user or system manager is able
       to more closely control which manual pages will appear  in
       each of the sections represented by menu items in the _S_e_c_-
       _t_i_o_n_s menu.  This functionality is  only  available  on  a
       section  by section basis, and individual manual pages may
       not be handled in this manner (Although  generous  use  of
       symbolic  links - ln(1) - will allow almost any configura-
       tion you can imagine).

       The format of the mandesc file is a character followed  by
       a  label.   The character determines which of the sections
       will be added under this label.  For instance suppose that
       you  would like to create an extra menu item that contains
       all programmer subroutines.  This label should contain all
       manual  pages in both sections two and three.  The _m_a_n_d_e_s_c
       file would look like this:

       2Programmer Subroutines
       3Programmer Subroutines

       This will add a menu item to the _S_e_c_t_i_o_n_s menu that  would
       bring up a listing of all manual pages in sections two and
       three of the Programmers Manual.  Since  the  label  names
       are  _e_x_a_c_t_l_y  the same they will be added to the same sec-
       tion. Note, however,  that  the  original  sections  still
       exist.

       If you want to completely ignore the default sections in a
       manual directory then add the line:

       no default sections

       anywhere in your  mandesc  file.   This  keeps  xman  from
       searching  the  default  manual sections _I_n _t_h_a_t _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
       _o_n_l_y.  As an example, suppose you  want  to  do  the  same
       thing  as  above, but you don't think that it is useful to
       have the _S_y_s_t_e_m _C_a_l_l_s or _S_u_b_r_o_u_t_i_n_e_s sections any  longer.
       You  would  need to duplicate the default entries, as well
       as adding your new one.

       no default sections

       Xman supports all standard Toolkit command line  arguments
       (see  _X_(_1_)).   The following additional arguments are sup-
       ported.

       In  order  to  specify resources, it is useful to know the
       hierarchy of the widgets which compose _x_m_a_n.  In the nota-

       _X_m_a_n defines all user interaction through global  actions.
       This  allows  the  user to modify the translation table of
       any widget, and bind any event to  the  new  user  action.
       The list of actions supported by _x_m_a_n are:

       GGoottooPPaaggee((_p_a_g_e)) When  used  in a manual page display window
                      this will allow the user to move between  a
                      directory  and  manual  page  display.  The
                      _p_a_g_e argument can be  either  DDiirreeccttoorryy  or
                      MMaannuuaallPPaaggee.

       QQuuiitt(())         This  action may be used anywhere, and will
                      exit xman.

                      Only useful when used in  a  search  popup,
                      this action will cause the search widget to
                      perform the named search type on the string
                      in  the  search  popup's value widget. This

                      action will also pop down the  search  wid-
                      get.  The _t_y_p_e argument can be either AApprroo--
                      ppooss, MMaannppaaggee or CCaanncceell.  If  an  _a_c_t_i_o_n  of
                      OOppeenn is specified then xman will open a new
                      manual page to display the results  of  the
                      search, otherwise xman will attempt to dis-
                      play the  results  in  the  parent  of  the
                      search popup.

       PPooppuuppHHeellpp(())    This  action may be used anywhere, and will
                      popup the help widget.

       PPooppuuppSSeeaarrcchh(())  This action may be used anywhere except  in
                      a  help  window.   It will cause the search
                      popup to become active and visible  on  the
                      screen, allowing the user search for a man-
                      ual page.

                      This action may be used anywhere, and  will
                      create a new manual page display window.

       RReemmoovveeTThhiissMMaannppaaggee(())
                      This  action may be used in any manual page
                      or help display  window.   When  called  it
                      will  remove  the  window, and clean up all
                      resources associated with it.

                      This action can only be used in the  "like-
                      ToSave"   popup   widget,  and  tells  xman
                      whether to SSaavvee or CCaanncceell  a  save  of  the
                      manual page that has just been formatted.

                      page or help display window, and will cause
                      the  informational display line to show the
                      current version of xman.
