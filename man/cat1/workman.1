       wwoorrkkmmaann is a graphical  tool  for  playing  audio  compact
       discs  on  a SunCD drive or other compatible unit.  It has
       most of the features available on standalone  CD  players,
       such  as  a  shuffle  mode,  programmable  playlists,  and
       elapsed/remaining timers.  But it also has extra features,
       foremost  of  which  is  the  ability to store information
       about CDs in a database, then automatically  extract  that
       information when the CD is inserted later.  WWoorrkkmmaann stores
       the artist's name, the disc title, the names of individual
       tracks,  and even remembers which tracks you don't want to
       hear!  All in an easy-to-use, attractive OPEN LOOK graphi-
       cal interface.

       Its only weakness, in fact, is that this is the end of the
       Description section of the manpage.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       generic-tool-arguments
              WorkMan should accept the  generic  tool  arguments
              described  in  xxvviieeww(1).   The exception is the -Ws
              argument, which can cause problems such as  the  CD
              Info/About/Goodies  buttons being whited out.  Note
              that olwm's "Save Workspace" menu option puts a -Ws
              argument  in  your  .openwin-init  file; you should
              edit it and remove -Ws and the two numbers  follow-
              ing it.

              Of particular note is the _-_s_c_a_l_e option, which con-
              trols the window size.  Use _-_s_c_a_l_e _s_m_a_l_l to  shrink
              the window so it takes less screen space.

       _-_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y _[_+_|_-_]_x_[_+_|_-_]_y
              Set  WorkMan's  position on the screen.  Do not try
              to use _-_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y to resize  the  window;  it  won't
              work and can mess up the display.  If the Y coordi-
              nate is negative (e.g.  _-_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y _+_1_0_0_-_5_0) the win-
              dow  will  be  positioned that many pixels from the
              bottom of the screen and will grow and shrink  from
              the  top, rather than the bottom; this prevents the
              controls from moving around  when  multiline  track
              titles  are  displayed, and is frequently used with
              the _-_l _0 option.  Note that the window manager will
              add  its  title  bar and push the window down.  Use
              something like _-_g_e_o_m_e_t_r_y _+_0_-_3_8 to position the win-
              dow  at the bottom of the screen.  38 is the height
              of the olwm border;  use  other  values  for  other

              window managers.

       _-_d     Don't  display  any  title  information in the main
              window.  This results in  a  smaller  main  window.
              The  title information can still be seen and edited
              using the CD Info popup.   If  _-_d  is  used  twice,
              title  information  will be displayed only if it is
              available; the default is to  display  "Unknown  CD
              name",  "Unknown  artist", and "Unknown track name"
              when the corresponding information is  unavailable.

       _-_D _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Set  the location of the CD database file.  This is
              a colon-separated list of filenames.   This  option
              overrides  the  value  of the WORKMANDB environment
              variable  and  the  workman.db.shared  resource  if
              either is present.  See the ENVIRONMENT section for
              more details.

       _-_h     Display a summary of options.

       _-_b     Toggle the use of Dismiss buttons on all popups and
              a Quit button on the main window.  Useful for users
              of window managers other than olwm.  On Sun and DEC
              systems, Dismiss buttons are missing by default; on
              HP systems, they are shown by default.

       _-_c _d_e_v_i_c_e
              Use   a   device    other    than    the    default
              (//ddeevv//rrddsskk//cc00tt66dd00ss22    or   //vvooll//ddeevv//aalliiaasseess//ccddrroomm00
              under  Solaris  2,  //ddeevv//ssrr00   under   Solaris   1,
              //ddeevv//rrssrr00  under Linux, and //ddeevv//rrssccssii under HPUX).
              This is useful if the CD drive is on a second  SCSI
              controller,  or  more  than one drive is present on
              the system.

       _-_s _c_m_d Send a command to a running workman process.  Valid
              values  are  ssttoopp,  ppllaayy, ppaauussee, bbaacckk, ffoorrwwaarrdd, and
              eejjeecctt.   Only  the  first  character  is  examined,
              except in the case of ppllaayy and ppaauussee (which require
              at least two characters).  mmuuttee and ggoo are  aliases
              for ppaauussee and ppllaayy, respectively.

       _-_o     This  option  prevents  the  Solaris 2.1 version of
              workman from spawning a background job to keep  the
              CD device open.  There is a bug in Solaris 2.1 that
              causes the CD player to stop  when  its  device  is
              opened,  unless  some  other  process on the system
              already has the device open.  When this  option  is
              specified,  the  CD will stop playing if workman is
              exited then restarted.  When the background job  is
              present  (_-_o  is absent) the eject button on the CD
              player does not work even after quitting from work-
              man.    The  background  job  isn't  started  under

              Solaris 2.2 if the volume manager is running.

       _-_l _n   Reserve some lines for track  titles  in  the  main
              window.  If _n is a positive number, that many lines
              of track title will always be  displayed,  even  if
              some are blank.  If _n is zero, the main window will
              grow and shrink to accomodate multiline titles.  If
              _n  is  negative (the default), the main window will
              grow when necessary, but will  never  shrink,  even
              when a shorter title is subsequently displayed.

       _-_e     Check once for the presence of a CD at startup.  If
              no CD is present, wait for the user to  select  the
              square  (stop)  icon  from  the  main  window.  The
              default is to check for a CD every  5  seconds;  on
              some  SunOS  versions,  the  CD-ROM driver prints a
              message to the console every time the  tool  checks
              for a CD.  After a CD has been detected once, work-
              man will revert to its default behavior (since  the
              driver  message  only occurs if workman has not yet
              found a CD in the drive.)   Specify  _-_e  more  than
              once  to  disable  checking for CD insertion perma-
              nently.

       _-_X     Exit automatically when the CD is ejected.

       _-_p _f_i_l_e
              Write the program's process ID to a different _f_i_l_e.
              By default, the PID is written to "/tmp/.wm_pid" to
              allow signals to be sent more easily (see the  SIG-
              NALS section below.)

       _-_n     No file locking.  On some systems, workman's use of
              file locking is a significant performance hit  (and
              on  older  systems,  file  locking  didn't work too
              well; on those machines, workman can freeze up when
              it  tries  to lock the database file.)  Use of this
              option is not recommended when several people share
              a  database  via NFS; if two people save CD entries
              to the database at the same time and one of them is
              not  using  file  locking,  one  or both of the new
              entries may be erased or stored incorrectly.

              Apply Sun patch 100075 to  your  system  (and  your
              fileserver,  if  you're  NFS-mounting  the database
              files) and you probably won't need to  use  the  -n
              flag at all.

       _-_V _n   Set  minimum volume.  CD-ROM drives made by differ-
              ent  manufacturers  have  different  volume-setting
              methods.   On  the  Sun  and DEC CD-ROM drives, the
              volume settings range from 0 to 255, but only  val-
              ues  of  128 or greater produce any sound.  On some
              third-party  drives,  though,  the  full  range  of

              volumes is available, in which case running with _-_V
              _0 is desirable.  The default is 128.

       _-_C     Close the CD device when the disc is ejected.   You
              shouldn't  need  to use this option unless you have
              unreliable hardware.

RREESSOOUURRCCEESS
       The following resources are available.  All resource names
       begin with "workman.".

       ddbb..ppeerrssoonnaall (string, default $HOME/.workmanrc)
              The  pathname of a file containing personal prefer-
              ence  information   about   CDs:   track   volumes,
              playlists,  and  the like.  This resource overrides
              the WORKMANRC environment variable, if present.

       ddbb..sshhaarreedd (string, default $HOME/.workmandb)
              A colon-separated list  of  database  files.   This
              resource  overrides the WORKMANDB environment vari-
              able and in turn may be overridden by the  _-_D  com-
              mand-line  option.  See the ENVIRONMENT section for
              more information about using lists of databases.

       iinniittiiaallVVoolluummee (integer, default varies)
              When a CD is inserted for the first time, or  Work-
              Man  is started when there is already a disc in the
              drive, the current volume level is  read  from  the
              drive.    On  some  systems  the  volume  can't  be
              obtained, in which case WorkMan by default will set
              the volume to 100%.  This resource allows a differ-
              ent initial volume to be set.  Valid values  are  0
              through 100.

       ssmmaallllBBuuttttoonnss (boolean, default varies)
              If true, use small (16x16) icons for the main panel
              buttons.  If false, use the old  32x16  icons.   If
              undefined,  the program will try to use the correct
              size depending on how big the rest  of  the  window
              is, which can be controlled with the XView "-scale"
              command-line option or by using a particular  font.

       aauuttooPPllaayy (string, default "normal")
              Controls  whether or not WorkMan will automatically
              start playing a CD when it's inserted.  Valid  val-
              ues  are  "never",  "normal",  and  "always".   The
              default is to play the CD if the personal  database
              says  to  do  so,  or  according  to the "Auto-play
              Unknown CDs" setting in the Goodies popup if the CD
              isn't in the personal database.

       rreevveerrsseeTThhrreesshhoolldd (integer, default 2)

              beginning of the track rather than jump to the pre-
              vious track.  Set it to  a  ridiculous  value  like
              999999  if  you always want the "back" button to go
              to the previous track.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       WORKMANRC
              The location  of  the  personal  preferences  file.
              This  file contains information such as the default
              volumes of  CDs,  playlists,  and  the  numbers  of
              tracks  to avoid playing.  It is usually not shared
              among several users of workman, since it  does  not
              contain any information about the CDs themselves.

       WORKMANDB
              Specifies  the  location of the CD database file or
              files.  Several files may be specified by  separat-
              ing  them with colons a la the PATH shell variable.
              For     example,     setting      WORKMANDB      to
              "$HOME/.workmandb:/home/user2/.workmandb"     would
              cause workman to look  first  in  $HOME/.workmandb,
              then  in  /home/user2/.workmandb.   New entries are
              saved to the first database in the  list;  modified
              entries  are  saved  to  the database in which they
              were originally found, or the first database if the
              original one is not writable.

              This  variable's  value  is overridden by the work-
              man.db.shared resource and by the  _-_D  command-line
              option.

SSIIGGNNAALLSS
       WorkMan reacts to the following signals:

       SIGTTOU
              Jump to the next track.

       SIGTTIN
              Jump to the previous track.

       SIGUSR1
              Pause the CD (if it's playing).

       SIGUSR2
              Play the CD (if it's paused or stopped).

       SIGQUIT
              Stop the CD if it's playing.

       SIGEMT Eject the CD.

       These signals, in combination with the pidfile (see the _-_p
       option description above), allow simple control of the  CD
       player  from  programs  or scripts, and are used by the _-_s

       option.

IINNTTEERRFFAACCEE
       Most controls have spot help; hit the Help key over a con-
       trol  to  find out what it does.  If you don't have a Help
       key, you can use the  xmodmap (1) command to make  one  of
       your  function  keys  act  as  a  help  key.  For example,
       xxmmooddmmaapp --ee ''kkeeyyssyymm FF11 == HHeellpp'' would make F1 bring up  help
       messages.

       The  following is a quick rundown of the controls; for the
       most part, they're pretty self-explanatory.

   TThhee mmaaiinn wwiinnddooww
       The main window contains the basic display and  most  com-
       monly-used  controls.  Moving from top to bottom and read-
       ing left to right, you'll see:

       The artist's name.

       The name of the CD or the title of  the  currently-playing
       piece of music, if it takes up more than one track.

       The title of the current track.  This may occupy more than
       one row on the screen.

       The track selection buttons.  Click on  these  buttons  to
       select  a  starting  track, or to change to a new track if
       the CD is playing.

       The track-position slider.  This is updated once  every  5
       seconds  while the CD is playing; you can also use it as a
       sort of jog dial to move around in a track.

       The volume slider.  Up is louder; down is quiet.

       The main controls (for lack of a better term.)   The  but-
       tons  on  the  top  row  move to the previous track, start
       playing, and move to the next  track,  respectively.   The
       bottom  buttons pause, stop, or eject the CD.  When the CD
       is paused, playing may be resumed by  clicking  on  either
       the  pause  button  or the play button.  The "back" button
       (the upper-left one) goes to the beginning of the track if
       it  has  been  playing  for  more  than 2 seconds (see the
       RESOURCES section.)

       The "stop mode" selector.  When wwoorrkkmmaann is done playing  a
       CD,  it  can stop, play the CD over again (the _R_e_p_e_a_t set-
       ting), or eject it.  Click the MENU mouse button to select
       a  stop  mode;  or  click  SELECT on the pull-down item to
       cycle through the available choices.

       The "play mode" selector.   This  determines  the  playing
       order of the tracks.  Two selections are always available:

       _N_o_r_m_a_l, which plays the CD from start to end, and _S_h_u_f_f_l_e,
       which  plays  the tracks in random order.  In addition, if
       any playlists have been defined, they'll  appear  here  as
       well.

       A  gauge  indicating  how long the CD has been playing and
       how much longer is left.

       Three buttons that bring up the About, CD Info, and  Good-
       ies popups.

       There's  not much to say about this; it's the credits with
       a couple of dumb pictures.

   TThhee CCDD IInnffoo ppooppuupp
       This popup is  used  to  enter  information  about  a  CD.
       Again, from the top:

       The artist's name.

       The title of the CD as a whole.

       A  scrolling list of tracks and their titles.  This can be
       used to view the tracks on a CD, or to select  tracks  for
       editing using the controls below.

       The  name  of  the  track that's selected on the scrolling
       list.  As a shortcut, if RETURN is typed after entering  a
       track  name,  the  scrolling list selection will automati-
       cally advance to the next track.  This allows you to  type
       in  all  the  track  titles  without using the mouse.  The
       track title can contain several special symbols that alter
       the  main window's display.  "//" forces a line break; the
       text after the "//"  will  be  displayed  below  the  text
       before  it.   WorkMan  will automatically split lines that
       are too big for the main window.  If a  line  begins  with
       "+", the main window's disc title display is replaced with
       the text after the "+" (useful  for  classical  CDs,  with
       several tracks that are part of the same work.)  If a line
       begins with "@",  the  main  window's  artist  display  is
       replaced  with the text after the "@" (useful for compila-
       tion CDs with tracks by several artists.)   Both  "+"  and
       "@" may be used alone on a line, in which case the program
       uses the title or artist from the previous  track.   If  a
       line  is  empty,  the corresponding line from the previous
       track   is   used.    For   example,   a    track    title
       "@Orff//+Carmina Burana////Stetit Puella" will replace the
       artist's name with  "Orff",  the  CD  name  with  "Carmina
       Burana",  and display two lines of track title, the second
       "Stetit Puella" and the first copied from the  first  line
       of title from the previous track.  (If this sounds confus-
       ing, don't worry -- play with it for  a  few  minutes  and
       you'll see how it works.)

workman(1)                                             workman(1)


       The  "Continuation"  selector.   If  this is selected, the
       current track is a continuation of the previous one.  This
       is  taken  into  account  when the CD is played in shuffle
       mode; if, for example, three tracks are part of  the  same
       piece of music (indicated by setting "Continuation" on the
       second and third tracks), they will be played together  in
       shuffle mode.

       The  "Don't play" selector.  If this is selected, the pro-
       gram will avoid the track when playing the CD (though  you
       can  still  play  the track by selecting it directly using
       the main window's track selection buttons.)

       The default volume setting.  Use this if a particular disc
       or  track  should  be played especially loudly or quietly.
       If the slider is all the way to  the  left,  there  is  no
       default setting and the current volume will be used.

       The  default  play mode setting.  When the CD is inserted,
       the main window's play mode selector will be set according
       to this item.  "From List" will select the first playlist.

       The auto-play setting.  If this is selected, the  CD  will
       start  playing  automatically  when it's inserted (even if
       the main window is closed to an icon!)

       Apply and Reset buttons.  Apply will save the CD  informa-
       tion to disk.  Reset undoes any changes you've made.

       A button to bring up the "Playlists" popup.

   TThhee PPllaayylliissttss ppooppuupp
       This  contains  the  controls  for  creating  user-defined
       playlists.  Any number of playlists may  be  created,  and
       they  can  be  as long as you like (until your workstation
       runs out of memory, anyway.)  The controls:

       A scrolling list, from which you can select a playlist  to
       edit or maim.

       The  name  of  a scrolling list to create, or the new name
       for the current list.

       A button which creates a new list, using the name above or
       a boring system-generated one if no name has been entered.

       A button to rename the current list to whatever is in  the
       Name field.

       A button to delete the current list.

       The  tracks  in  the current playlist.  To add tracks, use
       the popup menu (which appears when you hit the MENU  mouse
       button  over  the  scrolling  list.)   The  popup  menu is

       pinnable, so you can keep it  on  the  screen  and  select
       tracks quickly.

       A  button  to delete the currently-selected track from the
       playlist.

   TThhee GGooooddiieess ppooppuupp
       This  popup  contains  some   infrequently-used,   perhaps
       frivolous, controls:

       The balance setting.

       The  time display settings.  The running times to the left
       of the slider and gauge in the  main  window  can  display
       either  elapsed  time (the default) or remaining time; use
       these to choose.

       The auto-play setting  for  unknown  CDs  (CDs  which  you
       haven't  seen  before,  or which you saw before but didn't
       Apply to your database file from the CD Info window.)   If
       this  is selected, unknown CDs will be played when they're
       inserted.

       The controls for the A-B repeat function.  While the CD is
       playing,  click  the  Start  button to mark the start of a
       passage to be repeated; then click the End button when the
       CD  reaches  the end of the passage.  Click on the "Repeat
       section of CD" item to start repeating the passage (and to
       stop, once you've started.)

       The  Split  button.   This  button allows you to split any
       track in two.  Select a track from the  main  window,  and
       use  the  track-position slider to choose the split point.
       Then hit the Split button and the track will  be  divided.
       You  can  do  everything with the new section that you can
       with a regular track, including choosing a  name.   Tracks
       may  be  split while the CD is stopped or paused, or while
       it's playing.  This is useful if you wish to mark  a  sec-
       tion of a song, for instance; you can listen for the start
       of the section, and hit Split  as  soon  as  you  hear  it
       beginning.

       The  Delete button.  Use this to put a split-up track back
       together.  You can't delete the first section of a  track.

       A  button  to  scan  for index marks.  If a CD already has
       sections marked via index marks (usually indicated in  the
       liner notes), hit this button to search for them.  Search-
       ing for marks can take a while depending on the particular
       CD.   Every  time  an index mark is encountered, its track
       will be split as if you'd used the Split button.

       $HOME/.workmanrc
              Default location of personal preferences file.  See
              WORKMANRC under "Environment" as well as  workmandb
              (4).

       $HOME/.workmandb
              Default location of CD database  file.   See  WORK-
              MANDB under "Environment" and  workmandb (4).

BBUUGGSS
       The  program leaks memory with XView 3.0 (but not 3.0.1 or
       higher) due to a library bug.  The leak only occurs  while
       the About popup is displayed.

       Due  to  another  library  bug, the program will dump core
       when the default volume slider is wiggled back  and  forth
       under Solaris 2.  (The Sun bug ID is 1097908.)

       There  is no way to choose a playlist other than the first
       one as the default.

       Some of the options and environment  variables  should  be
       done with X resources or a properties sheet.

       The database should have an index of some sort for quickly
       looking up CDs, since the current linear search can get  a
       little slow on big databases.

       Interaction  with  data  CDs,  especially  ones  that  are
       mounted as filesystems, is spotty at  best.   The  program
       should unmount a CD before ejecting it.

       The  CD  Info  popup's  interaction with mouseless mode is
       annoying.

       If the volume manager (Solaris 2.2)  is  running  and  the
       "eject"  program  is used to eject the CD, a message about
       loading an unnamed CD will appear on the console.  There's
       nothing WorkMan can do to avoid that.

       The program's name is a pretty moronic pun.
