       _C_a_l_e_n_t_o_o_l is a day/week/month/year-at-a-glance  tool.   It
       is  a window-based calendar; the only time you should have
       to type is when entering  the  text  for  an  appointment.
       _C_a_l_e_n_t_o_o_l   provides   for  both  one-time  and  recurring
       appointments, as well as notes (appointments or  reminders
       with no associated time).  A period of advance warning can
       be specified.  A visual  warning  (and  optional  auditory
       bell) are produced at the approach of a scheduled appoint-
       ment.

       By employing appropriate options, this tool can be used to
       send  reminders of appointments by _m_a_i_l(1), and to examine
       colleagues  appointment  schedules.   Daily,  weekly   and
       monthly  schedules can be sent to a POSTSCRIPT(R) printer.
       Outdated appointments can  be  sent  automatically  to  an
       archival  file.  An extensive set of files containing com-
       memorative dates is included, as well as a library of rou-
       tines  which  computes the dates of various holidays which
       do not fall  on  fixed  days  of  the  Gregorian  calendar
       (including  religious  holidays  and astronomical events).
       Lunar and solar almanacs are also included.

       Although to take full advantage of _c_a_l_e_n_t_o_o_l you should be
       operating within the X11 or XNeWs environment, the --mm, --MM,
       --pp, --PP, and --TT options allow the Hacker's  Almanac  to  be
       employed  even  from ordinary terminals.  The accompanying
       utilities _c_a_l_2_c_t(1L), _m_o_n_t_h_2_c_t(1L), and _m_t_2_c_t(1L),  trans-
       form appointment files in _c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r(1), _m_o_n_t_h(1L), and _m_o_n_-
       _t_h_t_o_o_l(1L) formats to _c_a_l_e_n_t_o_o_l format.

       Instructions appear in the section DETAILED  INSTRUCTIONS,
       which follows the OPTIONS section.

       _C_a_l_e_n_t_o_o_l  accepts  standard _x_v_i_e_w command line options at
       the end of the command line. As well as  the  X11  options
       -fg,  -bg,  and  -geometry.  In addition, most options are
       also settable in the .Xdefaults file.

                      character  (along with the appointment mes-
                      sage) is sent  to  the  console;  only  one
                      reminder  is  sent  for  each  appointment.
                      Also, place a copy of the appointment  text
                      in  the  file  _$_H_O_M_E_/_._m_s_g_f_i_l_e.  The text in
                      this file is displayed by the  screen  lock
                      program _x_n_l_o_c_k(1L); notifying passers-by of
                      the user's current activity.

       --BB             Similar to --bb  except  that  the  _c_a_l_e_n_t_o_o_l
                      window  is opened instead of writing to the
                      console.  If  both  features  are  desired,
                      both options may be specified.

                      may take on several formats:

                      day of current week:
                             Tue, Th, fr, MONDAY

                      numeric dates:
                             DD (day DD  of  current  month,  for
                             example  27  for  the  27th  of this
                             month)
                             MO/DD (day DD of month MO, for exam-
                             ple 11/12 for November 12)
                             MO/DD/YY  (day  DD of month MO, year
                             YY, for example 9/1/88 for 1 Septem-
                             ber 1988).  (If the --ee or --EE options
                             are used, the date format  is  DD/MO
                             and  DD/MO/YY.  If the -D2 option is
                             used, the date format is  MO-DD  and
                             YY-MM-DD.)

                      relative dates:
                             +n  (n days from now, for example +1
                             for tomorrow)
                             -n (n days ago, for example  -1  for
                             yesterday)

       --DD _s_t_y_l_e       Set the date formatting style.  The default
                      (-D 0) specifys typical  U.S.  usage,  with
                      dates  formatted  as  MM/DD/YY.  Style 1 is
                      the typical (?) European usage, with  dates
                      formatted  as DD/MM/YY.  Style 2 is the ISO
                      standard (?) format, also used  in  Sweden,
                      with  dates  formatted  as  YY-MM-DD.  This
                      option overrides the -E option.

       --ee             Set  European  (ISO)  week  display  format
                      (Monday  through  Sunday).  When 7 day week
                      display is set, the display shows the  days
                      Monday  through  Sunday, rather than Sunday
                      through Saturday.  This  also  affects  the

                      month  and year displays.  With this option
                      the weeks are  numbered  according  to  ISO
                      standard.

       --EE             Set all European style options.  Currently,
                      this includes: --2244, --DD 22 and --ee.

       --ff _a_p_p_t_s_f_i_l_e   Use _a_p_p_t_s_f_i_l_e  as  the  appointments  file.
                      This  is  useful for seeing if other people
                      on the net are free to  attend  a  meeting.
                      If  everyone  exports his appointments file
                      (in a NFS environment) then people can plan
                      appointments more effectively.

                      File integrity can NOT be assured when this
                      option is in use;  if  two  people  try  to
                      write  to the same appointments file at the
                      same time,  the  result  could  be  tragic.
                      Only the person whose schedule is described
                      by a particular  appointments  file  should
                      have write permission for that file.

                      fall on set dates of the  Gregorian  calen-
                      dar.  Notes appear in the day and week dis-
                      plays, and marks appear in  the  month  and

                      a single character  which  indicates  which
                      set  of  holidays  is  to  be computed (the
                      option can be invoked multiple times on the
                      command  line).   The  character  codes for
                      supported date sets are:

                             increases.   It becomes long for the
                             month display and extremely long for

                      the  current  day,  week,  week  or  month,
                      respectively.   The _w option prints a weeks
                      worth starting at the beginning of the cur-
                      rent week.  _W prints a weeks worth starting
                      at the current day.  --pp  shows  all  notes,
                      while --PP does not show notes not marked for

                      printout  is  provided of the current day's
                      appointments,  if  there  are   none.    By
                      default,  the output generated by the -[pP]

                      printouts     where    the    default    is
                      POSTSCRIPT(R).  By using the --TT  option,  a
                      different      output      format     (e.g.
                      POSTSCRIPT(R)) may be chosen.  Month output

       Help  is available for most buttons, message items, panels
       and the main window by moving the cursor over the  desired

       When first opened, the tool displays the appointments  for
       a  single  day  (today  if  the  --dd  option  has  not been
       employed).  The day page for  today  is  patterned.   Each
       appointment  or  reminder  is  shown  at its start time in
       reverse video.  If the appointment lasts  longer  than  30
       minutes  an  arrow  is drawn from the starting timeslot to
       the end of the appointment.  If advance warning of  future
       appointments  has been requested, a popup display appears.
       The day display containing a  future  appointment  may  be
       displayed  if  the future appointment is selected with the
       _m_o_u_s_e_-_L_B (SELECT).  The reminder popup may be removed per-
       manently  (during this _c_a_l_e_n_t_o_o_l session) by selecting the
       DDiissmmiissss option;  if  the  KKeeeepp  option  is  selected,  the
       reminder  window  will  reappear each time the current day
       page is displayed.

       If there are multiple appointments sharing a time slot,  a
       MMoorree  button  appears to the right of the time slot.  This
       may be toggled repeatedly  to  view  each  appointment  in
       turn.   Any  arrows  for  hidden appointments are drawn as
       _d_a_s_h_e_d lines to show all scheduled time at a  glance.   As
       the  MMoorree  button is toggled, the arrows change state such
       that the new active appointment has arrows drawn as  solid
       lines  and  the previous appointment's arrows (if any) are
       now dashed.  If appointment text is too wide for  the  day
       page,  scroll  buttons appear to the right of the text and
       may be used to view the text in its entirety.  When  first
       displayed, all text is left justified.

       Appointments can only be entered in the day display.   The

       erally 30 minute intervals) as well as a _n_o_t_e_s section  at
       the end of the day page, to enter reminders not associated
       with a specific time.  To enter an  appointment,  position
       the  cursor  over  the  required  time  slot and press the
       _m_o_u_s_e_-_L_B (SELECT).  The slot is toggled to reverse  video.
       Leaving  the  cursor  positioned  in the slot, type in the
       appropriate descriptive text.  If  the  text  exceeds  the
       size  of  the  window,  scroll  buttons will appear to the
       right.  Typing new text into the time  slot  automatically
       right-justifies  the text already present, so that the new
       text  is  appended.   To  indicate  the  duration  of  any
       appointment,  click  the  _m_o_u_s_e_-_M_B (ADJUST) in the initial
       time slot (any existing duration arrow will be deleted); a
       vertical  indicator  arrow appears and follows the cursor.

       release  the  button.   The  SunView/XView  L6 and L8 keys
       (COPY/PASTE or PUT/GET) may also be used to paste the text
       from  the  shelf  to an active appointment slot or from an

       An  appointment  may  be further modified by selecting the
       pprrooppeerrttiieess option or pushing the Props key.  This causes a
       properties  subwindow  to  appear,  in  which the user may
       specify that the appointment is to be repeated every  day,
       for selected weeks of the month (first through fifth, last
       or every Monday thru Friday), every  month,  and/or  every
       year.  Alternatively, the appointment may be repeated at a
       specified interval of days.  The user can also  specify  a
       period  of  days  prior  to  the  appointment for which an
       advance warning will  be  printed;  how  many  times  this
       appointment  will  be repeated; and how many minutes ahead
       of the scheduled time the user should be reminded about an
       appointment  (default  is  10  minutes).  For example, one
       could specify that a meeting is to occur on the first  and
       third  Tuesday  of  the month, in perpetuity, by selecting
       the repeat options SSeelleecctteedd WWeeeekk, EEvveerryy MMoonntthh,  and  EEvveerryy
       YYeeaarr, as well as the selected week indicators 11sstt and 33rrdd.
       After selecting the  appointment  options,  the  user  can
       select  either AAppppllyy or RReesseett to close the options subwin-
       dow.

       Entering notes is similar to entering appointments, except
       that  no  duration  arrows can be appended, and the modify
       panel allows the user to indicate whether or not the  note
       is  to  be used to mark the month and year displays, or to
       be printed (or mailed) when  the  --PP  (or  --MM)  option  is
       invoked.

       The  PPrriinntt button prints a copy of the day, week, month or
       year display.  Pressing the _m_o_u_s_e_-_R_B (MENU) over this but-
       ton  produces  a  popup  menu which allows either a raster
       image or a POSTSCRIPT(R) version of the current display to
       be  printed.   A  third  option allows modification of the
       default print command.  The default print command is taken
       from  the  first  provided by the following sources: the X
       Resource data base, the _P_R_I_N_T_E_R environment variable,  and
       the  _P_R_I_N_T___C_M_D value provided by the system manager at the
       time of installation.  The printer output can also be sent
       to a file instead of directly to the printer.

       If the --oo option is in effect, at the end of  a  year  all

       are then deleted from the current appointments  file.   If

       are also copied to the outdated file,  rather  than  being
       purged.

       The  FFiillee  button  displays a window in which an alternate
       _._a_p_p_o_i_n_t_m_e_n_t_s file can be specified.  This is  useful  for
       maintaining  multiple  appointment  books or for examining
       colleagues' calendars.  The file can be made read-only  or
       read-write according to the toggle option, and a file name
       can be typed into the window.  The AAppppllyy button  initiates
       reading  of the currently displayed file, while the OOrriiggii--

       was  invoke  with.   The  RReesseett button undoes any filename
       changes that have been made prior to selecting AAppppllyy.  The

       Using an included file (see below)  is  the  one  instance
       where  manual  editing  of the _._a_p_p_o_i_n_t_m_e_n_t_s file is still
       required (although one could use the window-based aids  of
       _c_a_l_e_n_t_o_o_l to build such a file, by means of the --ff option,
       the include command must still be edited into the  primary
       appointment  file).   The  appointments file contains four
       types of lines:

       The first line in an _a_p_p_o_i_n_t_m_e_n_t_s file identifies the ver-
       sion  of  _c_a_l_e_n_t_o_o_l  in  use.   This  line should never be
       removed.

       A nnoonn--eeddiittaabbllee appointments file (for  example,  one  con-
       taining  site  specific  holidays) can be included.  Three
       formats are possbile for specifying such a file:
            #include "/pathname/file"
       or
            #include "file"
       or
            #include <file>
       In the second case, the file will be  prepended  with  the
       pathname  used  for  the  appointments  file.  In the last
       case, the included file is assumed to reside in a  system-
       wide  library directory specified at the time of installa-
       tion (see your system administrator).  The # mmuusstt start in

   CCoommmmeenntt lliinnee
       A  _#  in column one (not followed by the string "include")
       indicates a comment; the rest of the line is ignored.

   AAppppooiinnttmmeenntt//NNoottee eennttrriieess
       All fields are separated by at least one space  character.

   MMaannddaattoorryy eennttrriieess
       The  _Y_Y  field  is  the  year (00-99), the _M_O field is the
       month (1-12) and _D_D is the day (1-31).  The _D_D  field  can
       also  contain a two-character alphabetic string describing
       a day of the week: Su, Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa or MF  (Mon-
       day  thru  Friday).   This  feature is used in conjunction
       with wildcards (see below), and the _[_I_I_] field, which must
       appear  within  square brackets, and which can contain the
       digits 1-5 and the letter L, separated by commas, to indi-
       cate  the first through fifth (or last) monthly occurrence
       of the specified day of the  week.   _H_H  and  _M_I  are  the
       starting  hour  (00-23)  and  minutes  (00 or 30).  The _A_A
       field is the number of arrow bars  (additional  30  minute
       time slots) required.

   NNootteess
       A _H_H value of 99 indicates a note, rather than an appoint-
       ment, with _M_I designating whether presence of the note  is
       to  be  shown  (marked)  in  the month and year panels (00
       indicates that it is to be marked, 99  indicates  that  it
       should not be marked).

       A  double  asterisk (**) can be used in place of the year,
       month and/or day fields to indicate every year,  month  or
       day.

   OOppttiioonnaall eennttrriieess
       The _[_I_I_] field appears within square brackets, and (if the
       DD field contains a numerical value) is  taken  to  be  an
       interval in days between recurring appointments.  The _<_W_W_>
       field appears within broken brackets,  and  indicates  the
       number of days of advance warning required.  The _+_R_R field
       is preceded by a plus sign, and indicates  the  repetition
       count  for a given appointment.  The _%_A_A field is preceded
       by a percent sign, and indicates the number of minutes  in
       advance of an appointment the user should be reminded.  If
       this field does not exist, the default value of 10 minutes
       is used.

       If  a  #  character appears in front of the text, it indi-

       Please help extend the special dates files and date compu-
       tation  library  (only  carefully verified dates and algo-
       rithms, please!).  In particular, it would be splendid  if
       someone  would  expand  the range of astronomical computa-
       tions, which currently include only the equinoxes and sol-
       stices;  one  could  add  dates/times  of the major meteor
       showers, planetary risings and settings, etc.   Perhaps  a
       sailing  buff  could  build  in high/low tide estimations.
       The lunar calendar date computation library remains to  be
       completed.   There are many other historical and contempo-
       rary calendrical systems  we  have  overlooked  (Egyptian,
       Armenian,  Babylonian, Greek, Julian, Indian, and Russian,
       as well as ecclesiatical calendars  such  as  the  Alexan-
       drian).   The present dates library provides useful calen-
       drical computations not currently exploited by  _c_a_l_e_n_t_o_o_l,
       such  as  determining  the number of days, or weekdays, or
       Mondays between two dates.  Perhaps a third icon could  be
       placed  next  to  those  for the solar and lunar almanacs,
       which would open a  calendrical  computation  window.   It
       would  be  very useful if someone would write a _c_u_r_s_e_s(3X)
       based front-end for _c_a_l_e_n_t_o_o_l format date files for  those
       not  using  _s_u_n_t_o_o_l_s(1).   An  efficient way of doing this
       might be to merge _c_a_l_e_n_t_o_o_l with the  excellent  _D_a_t_e_s(1L)
       program of Dain Samples (samples@dougfir.berkeley.edu).

       An SunView version of _c_a_l_e_n_t_o_o_l is also available.

       Mail  suggestions,  corrections,  and  additions  for  the
       Hacker's Almanac to Bill Randle  (billr@saab.CNA.TEK.COM).

       Without a doubt, but hopefully pretty minor.

       Note  that  the  dates computed here are for the Gregorian
       calendar, which was a modification of the Julian  calendar
       first  introduced  in  1582.   Countries have adapted this
       system as recently as 1927 (Turkey), and in some countries
       it is used as a civil calendar in co-existence with a sep-
       arate indigenous calendar system.  Apply caution in  using
       computed dates for non-recent years and non-European coun-
       tries.

       The original suntools version of _c_a_l_e_n_t_o_o_l was contributed
       to  the  Sun  User  Group  tape  (17 April 1987) by Philip
       Heller (Sun Microsystems,  heller%terrapin@sun.COM).   Sun
       Microsystems  owns  this  program,  but has no interest in
       maintaining it.

       Extensive corrections and additions have been executed  by
       Bill  Randle (Tektronix, Inc., billr@saab.CNA.TEK.COM); it
       is likely that Phil Heller would recognize little  of  the
       current      program!       R.      P.      C.     Rodgers
       (rodgers@maxwell.mmwb.ucsf.edu, School of  Pharmacy,  Uni-
       versity  of California, San Francisco) performed extensive
       beta testing, made numerous design suggestions,  and  con-
       tributed  the  holiday  computation library, icons, manual
       pages, and special dates files for later SunView versions.
       The  initial set of special dates files were modified from
       earlier  net  postings  contributed   by   Rich   Kulawiec
       (rsk@boulder.Colorado.EDU)  and  Dick  Wexelblat  (...dec-

       vax!seismo!rochester!ritcv!ccieng5!ccieng6!wla), in  addi-
       tion to others whose identifications have been lost (speak
       up!).  More dates were obtained from "Today in History" by
       Robert Heckendorn at Hewlett-Packard in Fort Collins, Col-
       orado  (robert@fc.hp.com)  for  which  the  conversion  to
       calentool   format   was   done   by   Larry   W.   Virden
       (lwv27%cas.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.Edu).
