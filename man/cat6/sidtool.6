       _s_i_d_t_o_o_l  is  a  Pacman  like game. It contains a graphical
       interface for XView.

       _S_i_d_t_o_o_l is played by using the keyboard or  the  mouse  to
       move  the  image  of  the terminal screen around the maze.
       Running over (eating) a small dot is worth 10 points. Eat-
       ing  an  "idea"  spot is worth 50 points. During the game,
       pictures of fruit will be displayed in the middle  of  the
       maze. These range in value from 100 to 5000 points depend-
       ing upon how many screens worth of dots you have  cleared.

       There  are  four bad guys that are trying to eat you! When
       you eat an "idea" spot, it turns the bad guys  white.  You
       can then eat them. When they are about to turn back to bad
       guys again, they will  blink.  While  they  are  white  or
       blinking,  they  are  worth 200, 400, 800 and 1600 points.
       Avoid the bad guys at all costs when they are not white or
       blinking.

       You  get  three terminal screens per game. An extra screen
       is awarded at 10000 points.

       You can move the terminal screen around the maze using the
       hjkl  keys  (similar to the vi editor), or with the mouse.
       To go left, hit 'h'. To go down, hit 'j'.  To go  up,  hit
       'k'  and to go right, hit 'l'. Alternatively, you can move
       the mouse in the direction you want to go. Sun users  will
       also be able to use the four arrow keys on the right func-
       tion pad.

       There are ten skill levels. Level 1 is easy, and level  10
       is hard. Level 5 is the default.

       Initially the game is running in demonstration mode. Click
       SELECT on the Stop button, to display all the  other  con-
       trols.

       Click  SELECT  on  the  Help  button, to get a help screen
       describing how to play the game.

       Click SELECT on the Props button, to  display  a  property
       window allowing you to change the skill level and the num-
       ber of players. Don't forget to click SELECT on the  Apply
       button to apply you new settings.

       Click  SELECT  on  the  Scores button, to display a window
       containing the current high scores for each level.

       Click SELECT on the Quit button to terminate the game.

       Click SELECT on the New Game button to start a  new  game.
       Note  that  you  need to toggle the Play type from Demo to
       Game if you want to play a game (as opposed to running  in
       demonstration mode).

       Click  SELECT  on the Continue button to continue running.
       This button toggles between Continue and Stop, and is very
       handy  for those pesky telephone calls that always seem to
       interrupt the game.

       _S_i_d_t_o_o_l has been designed to allow you to  specify  alter-
       nate  mazes.  The  maze  layout  should be contained in an
       ASCII file, and conform to the following requirements:

       The maze size is fixed at 26 by 28.
       The maze is not allowed to have any dead ends.
       All boxes in the maze are defined by paths.
       The upper left corner of each box is signified by a  small
       s.
       Use the letters r,d,l,u to signify the direction to travel
       around boxes.
       Corners must be signified by changing the letter.
       The tunnel start must be signified by a capital S.
       The exit box must have the opening at the top.
       The ghost number 0 must be  started  directly  above  this
       exit.
       The exit should be signified by capital R's.
       All ghosts except for one must start in the box.
       The  amount  of  time spent in the box is specified by the
       number which shows where the ghost goes.
       Small dots in the maze are signified by periods '.';
       Large dots in the maze are signified by asterisks '*';
       Tunnels may be on left and right.
       All tunnels must have exits at both sides.
       There must be a row around the entire  maze  defining  the
       border.
       All non-tunnel parts of the border must be 'x's
       The  area  in  the tunnel in which the ghosts go slowly is
       defined as the area between the exit and  the  first  non-
       space  character.   Thus a '.'  causes the ghosts to speed
       up.
