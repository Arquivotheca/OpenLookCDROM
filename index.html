	Welcome to the Online Tour of The OPEN LOOK and XView Source and
		Documentation CD-ROM!
</H1>
<P>This CD-ROM compilation contains
<a href="http://www.darwinsys.com/">Darwin Open Systems'</a>
<em>OPEN LOOK and XView Source and Documentation CD-ROM</em>
(formerly called The OPEN LOOK GUI, XView and NeWS Archive). 
We have collected
<A HREF="book/index.html">three full OPEN LOOK textbooks</A>, the 
<A HREF="src/book-examples/index.html">example programs from several
OPEN LOOK and X11 programming texts</A>, the latest versions of
XFree86 R4, and many
<A HREF="src/xview/index.html">useful programs</A>. And we've compiled
many of them for both <A HREF="bin.linux/">Linux</A> and 
<A HREF="bin.sun">SunOS</A>, so that you can run them out of
the box on two of the highest-volume UNIX platforms in use today. We've
also provided 
<A HREF="index/index.html">pre-built search indexes</A> for Sun's
SearchIt and Adobe's Acrobat Catalog
searching tools to help you find specific information that you need.
<P>We've organized this online tour using HTML to allow you to browse
it with Netscape, Konqueror, or other browser
If you are on the Internet, this will <I>also</I> allow you to follow
links to the outside, which are scattered throughout the tour.
</P>
<P>Before you start, you may need to tell your Web Viewer about
certain file types. If necessary, the files in the WebHelpers directory
can be added to your .mime.types and .mailcap file, or can be used to
create those files. For other browswers, you may need to enter this
information manually in a "Helper Applications" dialog.
