> Welcome to the Online Tour of The OPEN LOOK and XView Source and
Documentation CD-ROM!</H1>
<P>We've organized this online tour using HTML to allow you to browse
it with Mosaic, Netscape, TkWWW, or your favorite Web viewer. If you are
on the Internet, this will <I>also</I> allow you to follow links to the
outside, of which there are some few scattered throughout the tour.
</P><P>Before you start, you may need to tell your Web Viewer about
certain file types. For Mosaic, the files in the WebHelpers directory
can be added to your .mime.types and .mailcap file, or can be used to
create those files. For other browswers, you may need to enter this
information manually in a "Helper Applications" dialog.
</P><P>This is The OPEN LOOK and XView Source and Documentation CD-ROM
(formerly called The OPEN LOOK GUI, XView and NeWS Archive). We have
collected
<A HREF="book/index.html">three full OPEN LOOK textbooks</A>, the 
<A HREF="src/book-examples/index.html">example programs  from several
OPEN LOOK and X11 programming texts</A>, the latest versions of
libraries,  and many
<A HREF="src/xview/index.html">useful programs</A>. And we've compiled
many of them for both <A HREF="bin.linux/">Linux</A> and 
<A HREF="bin.sun">SunOS</A>, so that you can run them  out of
the box on two of the highest-volume UNIX platforms in use today. We've
also provided 
<A HREF="index/index.html">pre-built search indexes</A> for Sun's
SearchIt and Adobe's Acrobat Catalog
searching tools to help you find specific information that you need.
</P><H1>Overview</H1> Here is an approximage pictorial overview of the

Release 6, Patch Level 11</A>
</LI>
<LI><A HREF="src/mgr/index.html">The MGR Window System</A> by Steve

the text books are covered by a separate <A HREF="license.html">license</A>.

</P><H2>Upgrades</H2>
<P>This is our first version of the <I>OPEN LOOK and XView Source and

it better over the next few months. If you're interested in an upgrade
at very reasonable rates, contact us at one of the above addresses or
try <A HREF="http://www.uunet.ca/darwinsys/olcd-upgrade.html">this</A>

</P><P>We hope to include 
</P><UL>
<LI>a single merged version of XView that compiles on every UNIX and
UNIX-like system in site and has all the latest fixes;
</LI>
<LI>still more XView programs;
</LI>
<LI>more commercial demos;
</LI>
<LI>everything for Linux compiled with ELF (which should be  in common
use by then);
</LI>
<LI>support for additional platforms
</LI>
<LI>better full-text indexing
</LI>
<LI>better hyperlinks in the PDF, particularly Volume 3 OPEN LOOK
</LI>
<LI>more and more useful full-text search indexes.
</LI>
</UL><P>In short, more of everything, and better.   But we can only do
this if we sell enough copies of the first version. So if you like it,
please tell your friends!
</P><P>If you'd be interested in an "inheritance filesystem" overlay
update, please let us know that too.
