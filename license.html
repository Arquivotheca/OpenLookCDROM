	<LI>The source code from textbook ("textbook examples") can be used for your own use but copyright is retained by the authors/publishers.
	<LI>All remaining source code is copyright by the authors or providers, as described in copyright, legal notice or COPYING files in each program's top-level directory and/or in the source files themselves.
