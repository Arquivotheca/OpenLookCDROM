Introduction

There are several World Wide Web newsgroups, and each of the groups
has its own Frequently Asked Questions posting (except for
comp.infosystems.www.advocacy). A set of answers to introductory
web questions can be found in the newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.misc;
consult the Frequently Asked Questions posting of that group first.

A complete hypertext version of the FAQ can be found on the
World Wide Web at <URL:http://sunsite.unc.edu/boutell/faq/index.html>.
If you can, consult the hypertext version; it's much more convenient!
