(shelby@dirac.physics.jmu.edu); 6/93]

There is an HTML widget in the NCSA Mosaic distribution.

Bristol's HyperHelp product is a help system based around a hyper-text widget.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  72)  What widget is appropriate to use as a drawing canvas?

Some widget sets have a widget particularly for this purpose -- a WorkSpace
or DrawingArea which doesn't display anything but lets your Xt application
know when it has been re-exposed, resized, and when it has received user key
and mouse input.

The best thing to do for other widget sets -- including the Athena set 
-- is to create or obtain such a widget; this is preferable to drawing into a 
core widget and grabbing events with XtAddEventHandler(), which loses a number 
of benefits of Xt and encapsulation of the functionality .  

The publicly-available programs xball and xpic include other versions.  The
Display widget in the XG library (libXG-2.0.tar.Z on ftp.x.org) provides a
generic way of drawing graphics in a widget.

The Athena Widget manual (mit/doc/Xaw/Template in the R5 distribution,
xc/doc/specs/Xaw/Template in the R6 distribution) includes a tutorial and
source code to a simple widget which is suitable for use.

The Free Widget Foundation set contains a Canvas widget.

An Xt Canvas widget by Jean-Michel Leon (leon@sophia.inria.fr) is intended to
provide graphical display and direct manipulation services for Motif and Xaw
clients. Available from avahi.inria.fr:/pub/widgets/canvas-widget-1.7.tar.gz,
ftp.x.org:/contrib/widgets/motif/canvas-widget-1.7.tar.gz.

The Knvas widget is intended to supply graphical display and direct
manipulation services for Xaw or Xm applications. Source is on
avahi.inria.fr:/pub/widgets/canvas-widget-1.7.tar.gz and
ftp.x.org:/contrib/widgets/motif/canvas-widget-1.7.tar.gz.  Info:
http://zenon.inria.fr:8003/~leon/widgets/canvas.html.

Controllers.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  75)  Where can I get an X server on a PC (DOS or Unix)?

       X11R6 contains sources for a number of X servers from XFree86, Inc.:
XF86_S3, XF86_Mach8, XF86_Mach32, XF86_8514, XF86_Mono, XF86_Bdm, XF86_SVGA,
and XF86_VGA16.  See xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86.  Also included in R6 is
Xsvga from SGCS and Thomas Roell; see xc/programs/Xserver/hw/svga.  All of
the above are Unix-based.

	X11R5 already provides a server to many 386/486 *Unixes* with 
support for many of the popular video graphics adapters; and for other 
non-MSDOS PCs you can obtain a server from these sources:

	XFree86 (formerly X386 1.2E) is an enhanced version of X386 1.2, which 
was distributed with X11R5; it includes many bug fixes, speed improvements, and
other enhancements. Source for version 2.0 [10/93] is on ftp.x.org in 
pub/contrib, ftp.physics.su.oz.au in /XFree86, and ftp.win.tue.nl in 
/pub/XFree86. In addition, binaries are on ftp.physics.su.oz.au, and 
ftp.win.tue.nl among other systems. Info: x386@physics.su.oz.au.
	Note: this package obsoletes Glenn Lai's Speedup patches for an 
enhanced X11R5 server for 386 UNIXes with ET4000 boards (SpeedUp.tar.Z on 
ftp.x.org).

	Metro Link Inc. (305-970-7353, sales@metrolink.com; in Europe contact
ADNT, (33 1) 3956 5333) ships an implementation of X11R4 for the 386/486 Unix
market.

	SGCS offers X386 Version 1.3, based on Thomas Roell's X11R5 two-headed
server, in binary and source form. Information: 408-255-9665, info@sgcs.com.

	ISC, SCO, UHC, and other well-known operating-system vendors typically
offer X servers.

	For MSDOS PCs:

Daniel J. McCoy (mccoy@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov) has started posting monthly a 
list of non-UNIX servers for PCs, Macs, and Amigas; it includes pricing 
information. The current copy is kept on ftp.x.org in contrib as 
XServers-NonUNIX.txt.Z. 

An article on PC X servers appears in the March 2, 1992 Open Systems Today.

	Also of possible use:

	Net-I from Programit (212-809-1707) enables communication among 
DOS, OS/2 and Unix machines and can be used to display PC sessions on your
Unix X display.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  76)  Where can I get an X server on a Macintosh running MacOS?

eXodus from White Pine Software (603-886-9050) runs on any Mac with at least
1MB of memory and supports intermixing of X and Mac windows and also supports
the SHAPE extension. Version 5.0 became available 10/93.

Apple's MacX runs on MacPlus or newer machines with >= 2MB of memory and
system software 6.0.4 or later. Version 1.1 is fully X11R4-based.  It

applications to display on an X-based workstation by turning the Mac into an
X client. [Note: there are questions on whether this product is still
available.]

Intercon has a product called Planet-X which enables Mac applications to
display on an X server.

AGE Logic will ship XoftWare for Macintosh in March 1995.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  77)  Where can I get X for the Amiga?

	The new Amiga 3000 machines offer an X server and OPEN LOOK tools and
libraries on a full SVR4 implementation.

        GfxBase, Inc. provides "X11 R4.1" for the AmigaDos computer; it 
contains X11R4 clients, fonts, etc., and a Release 4 color server. An optional

Subject:  78)  Where can I get a serial-based X server for connecting from home?

	Until LBX (q.v.) is more common, an option includes NCD's PC-XView
with PC-Xremote.
	sxpc 1.2 (by Robert Andrew Ryan (rr2b+@andrew.cmu.edu)) is a simple X
protocol compressor. Sources are on atk.itc.cmu.edu (in sxpc-1.0.shar.Z), or
from ftp.x.org (in contrib/sxpc-1.2.shar.Z)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  79)  Where can I get a fast X server for a workstation?

	The R5 server should be among the fastest available for most machines.

	Sun sells a "Direct Xlib" product which improves rendering for 
applications running on the same machine as the X server; the replacement Xlib
library accesses graphics hardware directly using Sun's Direct Graphics Access 
(DGA) technology.

Several companies are making hardware accellerator boards:

	Dupont Pixel Systems (302-992-6911), for Sun.

	Megatek's (619-455-5590) X-cellerator board for the Sun 3 and Sun 4 is 
based on the TI 34020; the company claims performance improvements of 5x to 
10x over the sample X11R3 server.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  80)  Where can I get a server for my high-end Sun graphics board?

       The R6 Xsun24 server supports the CG8 (RasterOps SPARC Card TC).  The
R6 Xsun also supports multiple framebuffers of the same type. (It's possible
that this code will work for a CG9, and for a CG12 as a dumb memory frame
buffer. The X Consortium doesn't have a CG9 or a CG12 at the X Consortium and
so is not able to provide support for these frame buffers.)

        Takahashi Naoto (Electrotechnical Laboratory, ntakahas@etl.go.jp) has 
modified the X11R5 server to support the Sun CG8, CG9, and CG12 boards.  
The files are on ftp.x.org in contrib/Xsun24-3.[01].tar.Z.  Note that both 
files are necessary to build Xsun24-3.1.

	The R5 Xsun Multi-screen server is a general purpose replacement for
the pre-R6 server/ddx/sun layer; it supports multiple framebuffers of the same
type and implements several other features above the Consortium implementation.
Available on ftp.x.org in the file contrib/R5.Xsun.multi-screen.tar.Z. [Kaleb 
Keithley, now kaleb@x.org, 12/91; the file was updated 24 Mar 1993.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  81)  Where can I get an "X terminal" server for my low-end Sun 3/50?

	Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu) has written Xkernel; the current
version [1.4 as of 8/91, 2.0 expected RSN] is on sol.ctr.columbia.edu 
[128.59.64.40] in /pub/Xkernel.gamma. It turns a Sun 3/50 into a pseudo- X 
terminal; most of the overhead of the operating system is side-stepped, so it 
is fairly fast and needs little disk space.
	A similar approach is to run the regular X server by making /etc/init
a shell script which does the minimal setup and then invokes Xsun, like this
example script from mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.EDU:

#! /bin/sh
exec >/dev/console 2>&1
/etc/fsck -p /dev/nd0
case $? in
 	0)	;;
 	4)	/etc/reboot -q -n
 		;;
 	8)	echo ND fsck failed - get help
 		/etc/halt
 		;;
 	12)	echo Interrupted
 		/etc/reboot
 		;;
 	*)	echo Unknown error in reboot fsck - get help
 		/etc/halt
 		;;
esac
/bin/dd if=/tmp-fs of=/dev/nd2 bs=512 count=128 >/dev/null 2>&1
/etc/mount /dev/nd2 /tmp
/etc/ifconfig le0 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 132.206.41.255
/etc/mount -o ro apollo:/u2/x11/lib /local/lib/X11
/etc/route add default 132.206.41.1 1 >/dev/null
set `/etc/ifconfig le0`
exec /Xsun -once -multidisp -mux -query \
	`(sh -vn </local/lib/X11/xdm-servers/$2 2>&1)`

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  82)  What terminal emulators other than xterm are available?

People from PCS have rewritten xterm from scratch using a multi-widget
approach that can be used by applications. Emu supports features like color,
blinking text/cursors. Emulations can be added on the fly; one emulation
provided is for the Vt220. Version 1.3 is on ftp.x.org and on the R6 contrib
tape.  For more information, contact emu@pcs.com.

A set of modifications for color support to xterm is on ftp.x.org in
xterm_color.diffs.Z.

apparently a set of color modifications.

The Color Terminal Widget provides ANSI-terminal emulation compatible with
the VTx00 series; a version is on ftp.x.org in contrib/CTW-1.1.tar.Z. A Motif
version is on ftp.stna7.stna.dgac.fr in pub/Term-1.0.tar.Z.

kterm 4.1.2 is an X11R4-based vt100/vt102 (and Tektronix 4014) terminal
emulator that supports display of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text (in VT
mode).  Also supported are: ANSI color sequences, multi-byte word selection,
limited Compound Text support, and tab and newline preservation in
selections.  kterm 4.1.2 is also available from these anonymous ftp sites:

	ftp.x.org:contrib/kterm-4.1.2.tar.Z  
	kum.kaist.ac.kr:pub/unix/Xstuffs/kterm-4.1.2.tar.Z  [137.68.1.65]
	kterm-5.2.0.tar.gz is now on ftp.x.org [1/94].

mterm, by mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU, is an X terminal emulator which
includes ANSI X3.64 and DEC emulation modes.  mterm can be had by ftp to
collatz.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.78.1), in X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax.

color_xterm is available from ftp.x.org.

Cxterm is a Chinese xterm, which supports both GB2312-1980 and the so-called
Big-5 encoding.  Hanzi input conversion mechanism is builtin in cxterm.  Most
input methods are stored in external files that are loaded at run time.
Users can redefine any existing input methods or create their own ones.  The
X11R5 cxterm is the rewritten of cxterm (version 11.5.1) based on X11R5
xterm; it is in the R5 contrib software.  [thanks to Zhou Ning
<zhou@tele.unit.no> and Steinar Bang <uunet!idt.unit.no!steinarb>.]

XVT is available on ftp.x.org's contrib in xvt-1.0.tar.Z and xvt-1.0.README.
It is designed to offer xterm's functionality with lower swap space and may
be of particular use on systems driving many X terminals. A second version,
2.0, is on unix.hensa.ac.uk in misc/unix/xvt/xvt-2.0.tar.Z (see also
xvt-2.0.patch[12]).

x3270 is in X11R5 contrib/.

The typescript application and inset in the Andrew User Interface System
offers a shell script interface.  It does not provide curses support, but
does permit general cut/copy/paste to construct commands or extract a portion
of the log.

hanterm (2.0), by jksong@cosmos.kaist.ac.kr, is an xterm modified to support
Hangul (Korean writing system) input/output.  It's available at several
Korean archives(cair.kaist.ac.kr,kum.kaist.ac.kr,etc) and seoul.caltech.edu
in the US. This version makes obsolete an older version not based on xterm.

Another experimental hanterm implementation, hanterm (3.0 alpha), is underway
by Chang Hyeong-Kyu at chk@ssp.etri.re.kr; it was written to support a 3-byte
Hangul code (dictionary ordered), which can compose all possible Hangul
characters.

A GenTerm widget is on iworks.ecn.uiowa.edu.  It contains a pty widget which
can be attached to a shell.  Note that the vt100 emulation hasn't been that
well tested.

partial:
	- mterm, color-xterm, CTW and emu support colored text
	- mterm and emu support blinking text
	- mterm and emu support block and underline text cursors
	- emu supports a blinking text cursor

Subject:  84)! Where can I get an X-based editor or word-processor?

You can ftp a version of GNU Emacs, the extensible, customizable,
self-documenting, real-time display editor, including X11 support, from
prep.ai.mit.edu [18.71.0.38]:/pub/gnu/. Version 19 has some mouse/menu
support.

Epoch is a modified version of Gnu Emacs (18) with additional facilities
useful in an X environment. Current sources are on cs.uiuc.edu
(128.174.252.1) in ~ftp/pub/epoch-files/epoch; the current [8/92] version is
4.2. [In Europe, try unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de].  There are two
subdirectories: epoch contains the Epoch source, and widgets contains code
for adding scrollbars to Epoch.  You can get on the Epoch mailing list by
sending a request to epoch-request@cs.uiuc.edu.  Epoch is no longer
supported.  The official successor to Epoch is Lucid Emacs which is available
at cs.uiuc.edu in ~ftp/pub/lemacs.  All functionality which was only present
in Epoch is gradually being ported to Lucid Emacs.

XEmacs (formerly Lucid Emacs) is a version of GNU Emacs derived from an early
version of Emacs version 19.  It currently requires X Windows to run;  X
support is greatly enhanced over GNU Emacs version 18, including support for
multiple X windows, input and display of all ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) characters,
Zmacs/Lispm style region highlighting, a customizable Motif-like menubar,
more powerful keymap support, flexible text attributes, support on regional
and screen-local basis through X resources and/or lisp, and support for the
X11 selection mechanism.  Lucid Emacs is free; the latest version (9/94) is
19.11, and is available from CS.UIUC.EDU (128.174.252.1). See also
http://xemacs.cs.uiuc.edu/.

The vi-like editor VILE supports a pure-X mode, in which it operates much
like vi running in an xterm window.  Though not a strict vi clone, [x]vile is

most notably multiple buffer and window capabilities.  Version 5.2 [3/95],
which also supports Xt-based implementations (including a Motif version) is
available on id.wing.net in /pub/pgf/vile. Information: Paul Fox
(pgf@foxharp.boston.ma.us).
