Subject:  88)  Where can I get an X-based graph-drawing program?

Xgrab reads a textual specification of a graph, lays out the graph using
heuristics to minimize the number of edge crossings, and displays the graph
as labeled nodes and edges in an X window. Sources are on
ftp.cs.washington.edu (128.95.1.4) as pub/xgrab.tar.Z. Interviews 2.6 is
required. [12/93]

daVinci is a universal, generic visualization system for generating
high-quality drawings of directed graphs. Besides a novel automatic layout
algorithm for graphs, many interactive features such as fine-tuning of a
layout, abstractions and scaling operations are provided. A bidirectional
application interface is implemented for tool communication with arbitrary
programs. daVinci is available for Sun's and PC's with Linux from
ftp.uni-bremen.de in /pub/graphics/daVinci. Version 1.4.1 is current [12/94].

Subject:  91)  Where can I get an X-based PostScript previewer?

Ghostscript is distributed by the Free Software Foundation (617-876-3296) and
includes a PostScript interpreter and a library of graphics primitives.
Version 2.6.1(.4) is now available; the major site is prep.ai.mit.edu,
although ftp.cs.wisc.edu is also recommended. [6/93] Version 3.0 will include
a full implementation of PostScript Level 2.

GSPreview (by the Computing Laboratory of the University of Kent at
Canterbury) is an X user interface (WCL-based) to the Ghostscript 2.4-2.6
interpreter.  The source is available for anonymous ftp from ftp.x.org as
gspreview.2.4.tar.Z [9/94] or from
ftp://unix.hensa.ac.uk/misc/unix/gspreview/gspreview.2.4.tar.Z.

GhostView (by Tim Theisen, tim@cs.wisc.edu) is full-function user interface
for GhostScript. Check ftp.cs.wisc.edu or prep.ai.mit.edu for
/pub/ghostview-1.5.tar.Z [7/93]. There are also several executables available
on ftp.cs.wisc.edu:/pub/X/ghostview-exe for various architectures.

XPsView (by Francois Bourdoncle, bourdoncle@prl.dec.com) is a Motif wrapper
around PsView, which is a X11 DSC Document viewer that can use both XDPS and
GhostScript as the interpreter engine. An early version was an the Alpha
Freeware CD. More recent versions, which include batch translation of
PostScript files into PPM files, are on gatekeeper.dec.com in
/pub/DEC/PRL/psview-1.41.tar.Z.

Also:

ScriptWorks is Harlequin's software package for previewing and printing
PostScript(R) descriptions of text and graphics images; previewers for X are
available. For information call +44-223-872522 or send email to
scriptworks-request@harlqn.co.uk.

Image Network's Xps supports the full PostScript language and renders in
color, grayscale, or monochrome. Fonts displayed are anti-aliased. Info:
Image Network, +1 415 967 0542.

Digital's dxpsview runs on UWS 2.1 and 2.2.

at +1 617 621 9555.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  92)  Where can I get an X-based GKS package?

	The latest freely-available XGKS can be obtained from 
xgks-request@unidata.ucar.edu; this is a 2c implementation derived from the 
X11R4 contrib XGKS from IBM and the University of Illinois. The release
is on unidata.ucar.edu [128.117.140.3] as pub/xgks.tar.Z. [12/90]
	In addition, Grafpak-GKS is available from Advanced Technology Center
(714-583-9119).
	GKSUL is available from gks@ulowell.edu (ULowell CS department). It is
a 2b implementation which includes drivers for a variety of devices. It can be 
passed an X window ID to use. The package includes both C and Fortran bindings.

[11/90; from dsrand@mitre.org and from stew@hanauma.stanford.edu]

	An XgksWidget is produced by Neil Bowers (neilb@leeds.dcs; 
neilb@dcs.leeds.ac.uk); the latest [10/91] conforms with the new version of 
XGKS (2.4). It is available on ftp.x.org in contrib/xgks-widget.tar.Z. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  93)  Where can I get an X-based GL package?

Ygl 2.8 (by Fred Hucht, fred@thp.Uni-Duisburg.DE) emulates most of the two
dimensional drawing routines and the window, queue, color (cmap/RGB) stuff,
doublebuffering and more. Ygl is available from ftp.thp.Uni-Duisburg.DE
(134.91.141.1), as pub/source/X11/Ygl-2.8.tar.{Z|gz} [10/94].

Certain vendors (SGI, IBM) are offering a GL package for X.

VOGL/VOGLE from gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au: /pub/vogle.tar.{Z.gz} and
pub/vogl.tar.{Z.gz} handle 3D drawing operations.  VOGL is closer to GL than
VOGLE.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  94)  Where can I get an X-based PEX package?

The first official release of PEX is with X11R5; fix-22 brings the Sample
Implementation server to version 5.1.

The PEX 5.2 Protocol specification is now available via anonymous ftp to
ftp.x.org, in the directory /pub/DOCS/PEX/. [8/94]


There is now available from the University of Illinois an implementation of
the PEX 4.0 specification called UIPEX. It contains a "near- complete"
implementation of PHiGS and PHiGS PLUS. The file pub/uipex/uipex.tar.Z is on
a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1); the porting platform was an RT running 4.3.
Questions and comments can to go uipex@cs.uiuc.edu.

In addition, the PEXt toolkit by Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com) is
available on ftp.x.org as PEXt.tar.Z; it includes a PEX widget making it
easier to include PEX in Xt-based programs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  95)  Where can I get an X-based TeX or DVI previewer?

	The xtex previewer for TeX files is available from a number of archive 
sites, including uunet; the current version is usually on ftp.cs.colorado.edu
(128.138.204.31) in SeeTeX-2.18.5.tar.Z; pre-converted fonts are also on that 
machine. The distribution all includes "mftobdf" which converts PK, GF, and PXL
fonts to BDF format, where they can then be compiled for use by your local X
server. 
	The xdvi dvi-previewer is fairly comprehensive and easy to use. It is 
also available from a number of sites, including uunet and ftp.x.org; current 
version is patchlevel 16 [12/92].

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  96)  Where can I get an X-based troff previewer?

xditview, a previewer for device-independent troff, is in contrib in X11R6;
it was a supported client in X11R5 and X11R4. X11R4 also offers the
contributed xtroff; an earlier version of xtroff also appeared on the R3
contributed source.

In addition, the xman client can be used to preview troff documents which use
the -man macros (i.e. man pages).

If psroff is used its output can be viewed with a PostScript previewer.

Groff, a C++-based [tn]roff document formatter from the Free Software
Foundation, includes an X-based document previwer based probably on
xditview.  Groff can put out both dvi and PostScript, so xdvi or GhostView
can be used to preview formatted documents.

In addition:

xproof, an X previewer for ditroff has been contributed by Marvin Solomon
(solomon@cs.wisc.edu); version 3.5 is available on ftp.x.org in
contrib/xproof*. [8/90]

Elan Computer Group (CA: 415-964-2200) produces eroff, a modified troff
implementation, and Elan/Express, an X11 eroff previewer.

SoftQuad (416-239-4801, USA only 800-387-2777; mail@sq.com) offers SoftQuad
Publishing Software, including a substantially- rewritten troff formatter, a
better intermediate language with backwards compatibility, and an X11[R3,R4]
previewer. (This is the package adopted by AT&T's own MIS department, and
used in and re-sold by many parts of AT&T).  [information from Ian Darwin,
SoftQuad (ian@sq.com) 3/90]

Image Network (1-800-TOXROFF; CA: 415-967-0542) offers the Xroff package,
which includes a fine modified troff implementation and a set of X11-based
page previewers. (This is the package OEM'ed by several hardware vendors.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  97)! Where can I get a WYSIWYG interface builder (or other shortcuts)?

	A release of the DIRT interface builder by Richard Hesketh works with
X11R5 and includes some support for the Motif widget set. It generates
WCL-1.1 code. DIRT is known to be outdated. It is available through
comp.sources.x archives.

	The InterViews 3.0.1 C++ toolkit contains a WYSIWIG interface builder 
called ibuild. ibuild generates code for an InterViews application complete 
with Imakefile and an X-resource file. Documentation is /pub/papers/ibuild.ps 
on interviews.stanford.edu (36.22.0.175).
	Quest Windows's (408-496-1900) ObjectViews C++ package includes an
interactive building tool. 

	Druid (Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development) runs on SPARC 
machines using OSF/Motif 1.0; it is intended eventually to be a full UIMS but 
apparently now has only support for creating the presentation components, for 
which it generates C/UIL code. Info: Singh G, Kok CH, Ngan TY, "Druid: A System
for Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development". Proc. ACM SIGGRAPH Symp 
on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST'90). ACM, NY, 1990, pp:167-177.

	The XF builder (version 2.3.n) is a TCL/Tk builder; versions are on
harbor.ecn.purdue.edu. You may subscribe to a mailing list by sending
"sub xf-l <Your name>" to listserv@tubvm.cs.tu-berlin.de.

	ADEW in the Andrew User Interface System supports WYSIWYG user
interface construction with the full selection of AUIS insets, including text,
rasters, tables, and the usual interactors.  Semantics can be coded in C or in
Ness, the AUIS extension language.

	Camel, a generic IDT for Xt widget sets, is available from 
R.N.Tearle@hertfordshire.ac.uk.

Also:
	In addition, these commercial products (unsorted) are available in 
final or prerelease form [the * following the product name indicates that the 
product is known to allow the designer to specify for each widget whether a 
particular resource is hard-coded or written to an application defaults file,
for at least one form of output]. Some are much more than user-interface tools;
some are full user interface management systems; information on most is not

ParcPlace is making freely available its popular ObjectBuilder(tm) and Object
Interface (OI(tm)) products for the Linux operating system.  ObjectBuilder is
a GUI builder written completely in C++, that enables UNIX C++ developers to
apply the principles of object-orientation to the development of user
interfaces. OI, a C++ class library, provides the toolkit foundation for
ObjectBuilder. OI implements the look-and-feel of both Motif 1.2 and OPEN
LOOK. OI is built directly on top of Xlib and is unencumbered by runtime
royalties to any party.  ObjectBuilder and OI are very extensible, actively
facilitating the use of subclassing to create new, reusable, user interface
components.  Sources are on tsx-11.mit.edu in /pub/linux/packages/OI and
available from ParcPlace (+1 408 481 9090).

Neuron Data (1 415 321-4488) makes Open Interface, a
window-system-independent object toolkit which supports interfaces which are
or resemble (supersets of) Mac, Windows, and Motif and Open Look; the package
includes an interface builder.

The GRAMMI builder supports the development of Ada/X applications using its
own set of objects which have Motif look and feel.  GRAMMI is written in Ada
and generates Ada specs and stub bodies.  Call 1-800-877-1815 or send mail to
info_server@evb.com with subject "send grammi" [without quotes].

In addition, these non-WYSIWYG but related products may help for goals of
rapid prototyping of the application interface:

WCL: the Widget Creation Library. Basically describes the widget hierarchy
and actions in a resources file; available from fine archive servers
everywhere, including devvax.jpl.nasa.gov (128.149.1.143) in pub/. Wcl
provides a very thin layer over Xt without any internal tweaking. Version 2.7
is in ftp.x.org:~ftp/contrib/devel_tools/Wcl-2.7.tar.Z[gz] [12/94]. (A
tutorial on WCL is available by telnet'ing to techinfo.mit.edu and using
"search iap292".)

TCL/TK: TK is a Motif-like object set for use with the TCL scripting
language. There is also a package tclMotif on ftp.x.org which may be used to
add TCL scripting to Motif programs; version 1.4 was released 4/95.

WAFE: Wafe is a package that implements a symbolic interface to the Athena
widgets (X11R5) and OSF/Motif.  A typical Wafe application consists of two
parts: a front-end (Wafe) and an application program which runs typically as
a separate process. The application program can be implemented in an
arbitrary programming language and talks to the front-end via stdio.  Since
Wafe (the front-end) was developed using the extensible TCL shell, an
application program can dynamically submit requests to the front-end to build
up the graphical user interface; the application can also down-load
application specific procedures into the front-end, which can be executed
without interaction with the application program.  Wafe 1.0 is available from
ftp.wu-wien.ac.at:pub/src/X11/wafe/wafe-1.0.tar.gz [7/94].

XGEN: a scripting language which can be used to prototype Motif environments;
available on ftp.x.org.

WINTERP: an Xlisp-based Motif toolkit (by Niels Mayer) allows for rapid
prototyping and interpretive programming. Its interactive application
development and delivery environment features a high-level object-oriented
interface to the OSF/Motif Widgets and Xtoolkit, a high-level object-oriented
2.5D graphics/animation widget based on Xtango's path-transition animation
paradigm, and facilities for communicating with other Unix processes and
data.  WINTERP's interpreter is "serverized" so that other applications can
communicate with WINTERP-based applications via unix domain sockets, or
optionally, through internet domain sockets. WINTERP's built-in interpreter
is based on XLISP-PLUS, which is a small, fast, portable, C-implemented
interpreter providing a subset of Common-Lisp functionality and a
Smalltalk-inspired object system.  A major new release, WINTERP 2.03, is on
the X11R6 contrib tapes; version 2.03 [7/94] is on ftp.x.org in
/contrib/devel_tools. Info:  winterp-source@netcom.com. See also
http://www.eit.com/software/winterp/winterp.html

The Serpent UIMS permits the building of user-interfaces without specific
knowledge of coding but with an understanding of attributes being set on a
particular [Motif] widget.  Beta Release 1.2 is available from
ftp.sei.cmu.edu (128.237.1.13) and can be found in /pub/serpent.  Serpent is
also available on ftp.x.org (18.24.0.11) in /contrib/serpent. Email questions
can go to serpent@sei.cmu.edu. A commercial version of Serpent is available
as "Agora" from ASET, 221 Woodhaven Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15228.

Garnet is a Common Lisp-based GUI toolkit. Information is available from
garnet@cs.cmu.edu.

MetaCard is a hypertext/Rapid Application Development environment similar to
Apple/Claris Corporation's HyperCard (info@metacard.com). MetaCard is
available via anonymous FTP from ftp.metacard.com, csn.org, or
128.138.213.21. (Mailing list: listserv@grot.starconn.com).

XForms, at bloch.phys.uwm.edu as /pub/xforms, includes a set of Xlib-based
objects, configurable to look like Motif and permits interactive placement of
them.

Articles comparing these tools include:

Subject:  98)  Where can I find X tools callable from shell scripts?
I want to have a shell script pop up menus and yes/no dialog boxes if the user 
is running X.

	Several tools in the R3 contrib/ area were developed to satisfy these
needs: yorn pops up a yes/no box, xmessage displays a string, etc. There are
several versions of these tools; few, if any, have made it to the R4 contrib/ 
area, though they may still be available on various archive sites.
	XScript, a collection of X shell scripts, is on csc.canberra.edu.au 
under /pub/motif/xscript and also on ftp.x.org; it includes several stand-alone
X applications which can be embedded in shell scripts. XScript requires 
tclMotif 1.0 or later.
	In addition, Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) has posted the xmenu
package to comp.sources.x ("v08i008: xmenu") for 1-of-n choices.  [7/90]
	Two versions of XPrompt have been posted to comp.sources.x, the latter
being an unauthorized rewrite. [R. Forsman (thoth@reef.cis.ufl.edu), 1/91]
	There is a version of XMenu available from comp.sources.x; it is
being worked on and will likely be re-released.
	xp-1.1.tar.Z, xpick-1.0.tar.Z and xzap-1.0.tar.Z on ftp.x.org's 
contrib/ are tools by Gerry.Tomlinson@newcastle.ac.UK which act as X versions
of the simple display and choice-making tools in K&P. [4/92]
	xtpanel lets the user build a panel containing interactive objects such
as buttons, sliders, text fields, etc., either from the command line or using a
simple scripting language. It is available for anonymous ftp from 
hanauma.Stanford.EDU (36.51.0.16) as pub/X/xtpanel-3.01.tar.Z and may also be 
found in the alt.sources archives.

Subject: 100)  How can I "tee" an X program identically to several displays? 

There are several protocol multiplexer tools which provide for the
simultaneous display of X clients on any number of machines:

XMX (an X Protocol Multiplexor) is available from wilma.cs.brown.edu
(128.148.33.66) as pub/xmx.tar.Z It works independently of the server and
does not affect the application being shared; it was developed for use in the
electronic classroom. An update is expected soon [5/93].

Subject: 101)  Can I use C++ with X11? Motif? XView?

The X11R4 and later header files are compatible with C++. The Motif 1.1
header files are usable as is inside extern "C" {...}. However, the
definition of String in Intrinsic.h can conflict with the libg++ or other
String class and needs to be worked around.

Some other projects which can help:

WWL, a set of C++ classes by Jean-Daniel Fekete to wrap X Toolkit widgets,
available via anonymous FTP from ftp.x.org as contrib/WWL-1.2.tar.Z [7/92] or
lri.lri.fr (129.175.15.1) as pub/WWL-1.2.tar.Z.  It works by building a set
of C++ classes in parallel to the class tree of the widgets.

The C++ InterViews toolkit is obtainable via anonymous FTP from
interviews.stanford.edu. InterViews uses a box/glue model similar to that of
TeX for constructing user interfaces and supports multiple looks on the user
interfaces. Some of its sample applications include a WYSIWIG document editor
(doc), a MacDraw-like drawing program (idraw) and an interface builder
(ibuild).

THINGS,  a class library written at the Rome Air Force Base by the Strategic
Air Command, available as freeware on archive sites.

Motif++ is a public-domain library that defines C++ class wrappers for Motif
1.1 and 1.2; it adds an "application" class for, e.g., initializing X, and
also integrates WCL and the Xbae widget set. This work was developed by
Ronald van Loon <rvloon@motif.xs4all.nl> based on X++, a set of bindings done
by the University of Lowell Graphics Research Laboratory. The current sources
are available from decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1) in

The source code examples for Doug Young's "Object-Oriented Programming with
C++ and OSF/Motif" [ISBN 0-13-630252-1] do not include "widget wrappers" but
do include a set of classes that encapsulates higher-level facilities
commonly needed by Motif- or other Xt-based applications; check ftp.x.org in

a C++-based toolkit for multiple window systems, including PM, Windows, and
X/Motif.

Xv++ is sold by Qualix (415-572-0200; fax -1300); it implements an interface
from the GIL files that Sun's OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0 produces to
Xview wrapper classes in C++.

The Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) library from Bristol (info@bristol.com)
is a GUI class library for Windows, Mac, and Motif applications.

UIT is a set of C++ classes embedding the XView toolkit; it is intended for
use with Sun's OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0 builder tool. Sources are on

Subject: 102)  Where can I obtain alternate language bindings to X/Xt/Motif?

	Versions of the CLX Lisp bindings are part of the X11 core source 
distributions. A version of CLX is on the R5 tape [10/91]; version 5.0.2 [9/92]
is on ftp.x.org in /contrib/CLX.R5.02.tar.Z.

	The SAIC Ada-X11 bindings are through anonymous ftp in /pub from
stars.rosslyn.unisys.com (128.126.164.2) [perhaps
falcon.stars.ballston.paramax.com (129.204.6.253)?]
	There is an X/Ada study team sponsored by NASA JSC, which apparently is
working out bindings. Information: xada@ghg.hou.tx.us.
	GNU SmallTalk has a beta native SmallTalk binding to X called STIX (by
Steven.Byrne@Eng.Sun.COM). It is still in its beginning stages, and 
documentation is sparse outside the SmallTalk code itself. The sources are 
available as /pub/gnu/smalltalk-1.1.1.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu (18.71.0.38) or 
ugle.unit.no (129.241.1.97).
	Prolog bindings (called "XWIP") written by Ted Kim at UCLA while
supported in part by DARPA are available by anonymous FTP from
ftp.x.org:contrib/xwip.tar.Z or ftp.cs.ucla.edu:pub/xwip.tar.Z.
These prolog language bindings depend on having a Quintus-type foreign function
interface in your prolog. The developer has gotten it to work with Quintus and 
SICStus prolog. Inquiries should go to xwip@cs.ucla.edu. [3/90]
	Scheme bindings to Xlib, OSF/Motif, and Xaw are part of the Elk
distribution; version 1.5a on ftp.x.org obsoletes the version on the R5 contrib
tape. 
	TCL bindings to Motif 1.[12] by Jan Newmarch 
(jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) are on csc.canberra.edu.au and ftp.x.org. 
Version 0.8 became available 11/93.
	x-scm, a bolt-on accessory for Aubrey Jaffer's "scm" Scheme interpreter
that provides an interface to Xlib, Motif, and OpenLook, is now available via 
FTP from altdorf.ai.mit.edu:archive/scm/xscm1.05.tar.Z and 
nexus.yorku.ca:pub/scheme/new/xscm1.05.tar.Z.

	Poplog V14.2 is offered by Integral Solutions Ltd. (Phone +44 (0)256
882028; Fax +44 (0)256 882182; Email isl@integ.uucp); it is an integrated
programming environment consisting of the programming languages Pop-11,
Prolog, Standard ML, and Lisp which are compiled to machine code via a common
virtual machine. Pop-11 provides an interface to the X Toolkit which can be
accessed from all other Poplog languages. The OLIT, Motif, and Athena widget
sets are supported, in addition to the custom Poplog (Xpw) widget set.
High-level Pop-11 libraries allow graph drawing, turtle graphics, and the
simple creation of basic button/menu based interfaces.

	Ada bindings to Motif, explicitly, will eventually be made available by
the Jet Propulsion Laboratories, probably through the normal electronic
means.  Advance information can be obtained from dsouleles@dsfvax.jpl.nasa.gov,
who may respond as time permits.
	AdaMotif is a complete binding to X and Motif for the Ada language, for
many common systems; it is based in part upon the SAIC/Unisys bindings and also
includes a UIL to Ada translator. Info: Systems Engineering Research 
Corporation, 1-800-Ada-SERC (well!serc@apple.com).

Subject: 103)  TOPIC: BUILDING THE X DISTRIBUTION [topic needs updating to R6]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 104)  What's a good source of information on configuring the X build?

	This FAQ includes information on a number of "gotchas" that can bite 
you on particular system. However, the best source of general information on 
building the X11 release is found in the Release Notes. The file is bundled 
separately from the rest of the release, so if it's become separated from your 
sources you can FTP another copy separately: the file RELNOTES.[ms,PS,TXT] at 
the top of the distribution. The file RELNOTES is also available from the 
xstuff mail server.
	In addition, O'Reilly & Associates' Volume 8 on X Administration
includes information on configuring and building X.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 105)  Why doesn't my Sun with a cg6 work with R5?

	Apparently gcc is the problem; it seems to produce fine code for all
Sun displays except for the cgsix. The new sunGX.o distributed with fix-07 
may fix the problem (note: not known to work on Solaris).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 106)  Why doesn't my Sun with SunOS 4.1 know about _dlsym, etc.?

	If you get errors with _dlsym _dlopen _dlclose undefined, link with 
libdl.a.  Add "-ldl" to your and eventually to your site.def.  You may want to 
surround it with "-Bstatic -ldl -Bdynamic" if you add it to the EXTRA_LIBRARIES
variable, since "syslibs" get added after EXTRA_LIBRARIES on the eventual 
compilation command; otherwise you may not have a shared libdl.  (Or compile 
the stubs shared.)

[thanks to Joe Backo (joe.backo@East.Sun.COM), 12/91]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 107)  What is this "_get_wmShellWidgetClass undefined" error?

	In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts
with the way X builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols, notably, 
to be undefined when building some X11 clients on SunOS 4.1.[23]: 
	_get_wmShellWidgetClass
	_get_applicationShellWidgetClass
Compiling "-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic" is overkill; be sure to set
OSTeenyVersion correctly in the config/sun.cf file and rebuild X11R5.

To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please 
contact your local Sun office and request the following patches:

Patch i.d.      Description
100512-02       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch
100573-03       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using
                        shared libXmu

[Greg Earle, earle@Sun.COM; 7/92] 

A source patch for use with the X11R4 libraries was developed by Conrad 
Kimball (cek@sdc.boeing.com); it retrofits into R4 some fixes made in R5 to
get around this problem. The patch is on ftp.x.org in [1/93]
	contrib/X11R4_sunos4.1.2_patch_version3.Z

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 108)  Why don't xterm or xinit work on Solaris 2.4?

The Solaris FAQ describes a problem in which xinit dies with "user signal 1"
and traces it to some changes to libc.so and libthread.so. The Solaris FAQ
describes the necessary patch to obtain from Sun; the FAQ is available from
ftp.fwi.uva.nl in directory /pub/solaris.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 109)  What's this problem with undefined _X symbols on SunOS 4.1.3?

        Make sure to set the OSTeenyVersion in the mit/config/sun.cf file
if you see that vast numbers of Xlib functions are undefined in your X11R5 
build:

  >cc -o bmtoa bmtoa.o -O -pipe  -L../.././lib/Xmu -lXmu -L/work1/X11R5/lib
  >ld: Undefined symbol
  >   _XGetVisualInfo
  >   _XFree
	...

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 110)  Why does cc get used when I build X11R5 with gcc?

	When X11R5 was written gcc (version 1.X) did not support shared 
libraries. Those parts requiring shared libraries are compiled with cc, those 
that don't are compiled with gcc.
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 111)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc?
When I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error 
	"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. 
	Fatal server bug! no screens found."

	Running the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do 
this simple test:

	#include <sys/ioctl.h>
	SIOCGIFCONF

Run that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of 
interest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like 
whitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your 
fixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc
sources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are 
identical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make 
sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.  

[courtesy der Mouse, mouse@LARRY.MCRCIM.MCGILL.EDU; 9/90]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 112)  What are these problems compiling the X server on SunOS 4.1.1?
The file <sundev/cg6reg.h> isn't being found.

	Sun omitted <sundev/cg6reg.h> from SunOS 4.1.1. Remove the #include 
from sunCG6C.c and replace it with the line 
	#define CG6_VADDR_COLOR   0x70016000
The file has changed from earlier versions of SunOS and should not be copied 
from another distribution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 113)  Can OW 3.0 OLIT programs run with R5 Xt? (_XtQString undefined)

This is a bug in the OLIT.  _XtQString was an external symbol that existed in
X11R4 (upon which OW 3.0's libXt is based).  It wasn't documented and was
removed in X11R5 (the Consoritum's guarantee of upward compatibility between
the R4 and R5 libraries only applied to the documented interface).

A workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4
or OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.

(jpf@heliocentric.com)]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 114)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole?

	There is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload)
running under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using 
shared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:
	1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system
administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used
by these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security 
problems at your site.
	2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).
	3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths
to the libraries.

[from rws@x.org (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]

Newer versions  of xterm (R5/R6) do this automatically by rebuilding xterm
against the newly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this
prevents an suid program from being built with libraries specified
relatively. Note that this may cause an inconvenience when doing the
installation from NFS-mounted disks.  Xload has been rewritten to avoid the
problem.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 115)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?

	On many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits 
anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by 
accessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps
more annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console 
display. Check the man page for fbtab(5).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 116)  TOPIC: BUILDING X PROGRAMS 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 117)  What is Imake?

	Imake is not a replacement for the make program; instead, it is a
makefile-generator that takes advantages of the include-file and macro-
processing capabilities of the C preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles 
suitable for building software on a particular system. Although it is not 
specific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the 
configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.
	Imake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by
which the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration
files, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not 
obvious.
	There have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, R5
and R6 versions are different.

	You can obtain information on imake from these sources:
	- - the release notes and imake man page include information on using
Imake to build X
	- The R6 file xc/config/cf/README contains a list of imake variables
	- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on
using Imake to build X
	- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information
	- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4
guide to imake.
	- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim
Fulton on an early version of Imake

	- Paul DuBois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful 
explanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-
supported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu
in the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and 
config-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. 
[7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email;
mail a message body of "send imake-stuff help" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.
They are also available by gopher to gopher.primate.wisc.edu under "Primate 
Center Software Archives".
	- see "System Administration - Imake: Friend or Foe?" by Dinah McNutt
in the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.
	- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article "Das Meta-Make 
/ I make, you make / Schwerelos" by Rainer Klute in "iX 
Multiuser-Multitasking-Magazin", directed at application programmers needing to
write Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The
X Journal, issue 2:1.
	- The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on
demystifying Imake.
	- Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in 
sunline.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.
	- O'Reilly has published (7/93) "Software Portability with imake" by
Paul DuBois; ISBN 1-56592-055-4. The book's electronic examples and
additional software are on ftp.primate.wisc.edu in pub/imake-book;
imake.tar.Z is a stand-alone imake installation.

[1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92;7/93]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 118)  Where can I get imake?

	Versions are distributed with the R4, R5, and R6 releases. An earlier 
version is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits 
redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the 
template and configuration files. There are no real standards for such 
configuration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the 
templates distributed with X11R5.
	ftp.x.org contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up 
imake without picking up the entire distribution.
	A stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in
ftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).
	A stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in
ftp.primate.wisc.edu:pub/imake-book/imake.tar.Z.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 119)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?

	If you have R4 or later installed on your system, run "xmkmf". This
is a script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output
is a Makefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile.  Then
run make, which will use that new Makefile to compile the program.
