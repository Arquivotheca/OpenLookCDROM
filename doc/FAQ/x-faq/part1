the 1996 conference may be in the Bay Area.  It includes tutorials and
technical talks.  Registration information is available from
registration@x.org, fax +1 617-253-7002. Other information is typically on
ftp.x.org in /pub/DOCS/XConsortium/ (also
http://www.x.org/ftp/pub/DOCS/XConsortium).

Other trade shows -- UnixExpo, Uniforum, Siggraph -- show an increasing
presence of X, including tutorials and exhibits.

Subject:   4)! What X-related public mailing lists are available?

The xpert mailing list is the general, public mailing list on X maintained by
the X Consortium. The mailings are gatewayed, so xpert is almost identical to
the comp.windows.x Usenet newsgroup.

	***     If you get comp.windows.x, you don't need to    *** 
	*** 	be added to the xpert mailing list.             ***

Otherwise, you can join the list to receive X information electronically. It
is best to find a local distribution; perhaps someone within your company is
already receiving the mailing. As a last resort, send mail to
xpert-request@x.org with a valid return electronic address.

The xannounce mailing list carries major X announcements, such as new
releases (including public patches from the Consortium), public reviews,
adoption of standards by the X Consortium, and conference announcements.  It
does NOT carry advertisements, source code, patches, or questions.  If you
already receive the Usenet news group comp.windows.x.announce or the xpert
mailing list, you don't need to be added to the xannounce mailing list.
Otherwise, to subscribe, send a request to xannounce-request@x.org. Note:
only redistribution addresses will be accepted for this list -- i.e. no
personal addresses. If you wish to receive xannounce yourself, please contact
your mail administrator to set up a local redistribution list and to put you
on it.

comp.windows.x.apps is not gatewayed to a mailing list.

In addition, the X Consortium sponsors these public lists:
		bug-clx         CLX bug reports and discussions
		x-ada           X and ada 
		x11-3d          X and 3d graphics 
		ximage          image processing and X 
		xvideo          discussion of video extensions for X 
		x-agent		protocols for external agents (e.g. editres) 

To subscribe to any of the above mailing lists, send mail to the list with
"-request" appended; this example adds pat@mumble.widget.com to the xpert
mailing list:

	% mail xpert-request@x.org
	Subject: (none needed)
	subscribe xpert pat@mumble.widget.com
	^D

To unsubscribe:

	% mail xpert-request@x.org
	Subject: (none needed)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   7)  How do I ask a net-question so as to maximize helpful responses?

When asking for help on the net or X mailing lists, be sure to include all
information about your setup and what you are doing.  The more specific you
are, the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing.
Without all the details, people who want to help you often have to guess --
if they are able to respond at all.

Always mention what version of X you are using and where you got it from. If
your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system, give
details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S
version for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate
to mention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are
using.

Then tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what you
expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the exact
transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote doesn't
work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary (just a
small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?

The trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, etc.) are publishing more
articles on X.  Two X-specific publications include:

Subject:  10)  What is the ICCCM? (How do I write X-friendly applications?)

	The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the
official X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It
describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully
with other clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients,
you need to read and understand the ICCCM, in particular the sections
discussing the selection mechanism and the interaction between your client
and the window manager.

	Alternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in "RTFM" and is
the most-important of the least-read X documents.

Get the ICCCM from these sources:

	- Version 2.0 of the ICCCM is an X Consortium standard as of R6.  See
xc/doc/specs/ICCCM in the R6 distribution.

Older versions include: 

	- as part of the R5 and R4 distribution 
	- in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys "X Window System" book 
	- as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, "X
Protocol Reference Manual." A version in old copies of ORA Volume 1 is
obsolete.  The version in the Digital Press book is much more readable,
thanks to the efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and
the presentation.  [from David Rosenthal, 10/90]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?

	The X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the
development of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of
cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software
interfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment. MIT for many
years provided the vendor-neutral architectural and administrative leadership
required to make the organization work. The X Consortium is now an independent
consortium.

	Most of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail,
with meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape,
interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.
Typically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with
others acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete
specification is produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by
the Consortium as a proposed standard.  The standards process typically
includes public review (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof
of concept.

	Your involvement in the public review process or as a member of the
Consortium is welcomed. Membership in the Consortium open to any
organization; there are several membership categories.  Write to Bob
Scheifler, President, X Consortium, One Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA
02142-1301, or send a message to membership@x.org, or look in
/pub/DOCS/XConsortium on ftp.x.org, or use the URL 
http://www.x.org/ftp/pub/DOCS/XConsortium.

Subject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?

	OPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN
LOOK was developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers;
Motif was developed by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many
OSF members.

	OPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide;
there are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK
applications.  Motif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif
toolkit is the one from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be
used to produce programs which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these,
ParcPlace's (formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a "virtual toolkit" which provides
objects in the style of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.

	OPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising
their OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.

[Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]

	With the recent COSE announcement it appears that Sun will be phasing
out support for OPEN LOOK in favor of Motif.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  13)  What is "low-bandwidth X" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?

The one-line summary of LBX is:
	LBX  =  "XRemote"  +  reply/event/error compaction  +  caching

There are several options for using X over serial lines:

SLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP
packets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several
years, and implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP
implementations.  Most X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item,
although nobody really ever uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP
headers add 40 bytes per packet and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is
rather verbose (rightfully so; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over
high-speed links).

CSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the
40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do
anything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can
help, but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the
uncompressed data through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression
assembly time).

PPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point
links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation
than SLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the
serial line management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common
for running normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the
wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable.

XRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally
developed by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition
to using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes
redundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and
using LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a
pseudo-X server or "proxy" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There
are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:
   (1)  You don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't
	otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly
	connected), and 
   (2)  It reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes 
	that have to cross the serial interface, and 
   (3)  In addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering
	packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for
	blocks to compress.

LBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a
standard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using
NCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.
LBX will go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used
information (e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font
metrics, keymaps, etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The
hope is to have a Standard ready for public review in the first half of next
year and a sample implementation available in R6.

Additional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on
how LBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from ftp.x.org in
contrib/ in the following files:
	XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote
	XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX

[information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]

	There is also a set of slides on ftp.x.org from Jim Fulton's talk at
the 7th X Technical Conference.

	LBX is designated as a work in progress in R6.  See
workInProgress/README and workInProgress/lbx/README in the R6 distribution
for more information.

Subject:  14)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  15)  What are all these window managers? (Where can I get a "virtual" wm?)

The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the X
window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is no
single window manager; instead, there are many, which support different ways
for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,
decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological
order (generally, the more recent ones conformant more with the ICCCM):

wm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3

uwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, although it
is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.

twm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-Consortium window
managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a
re-parenting window manager.

awm: the Ardent Window Manager was for a while a hotbed for hackers and
offered some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window
managers

rtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap and
resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.

dxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering

hpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm

mwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit

tekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering

olwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style Guide
functionality

olwm (AT&T): ditto

gwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in Lisp
interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7p-beta1 is on
koala.inria.fr:/pub/gwm/gwm-1.7p_beta_1.tar.gz and
ftp.x.org:/contrib/window_managers/gwm-1.7p_beta_1.tar.gz. [4/95]

m_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape

pswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release

swm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple GUI
support and also a panning virtual window; configuration information comes
from the resources file. Sources are on ftp.x.org in contrib/swm.tar.Z; they
require OI binaries.

twm (new): the new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked twm and
is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on later X releases

vtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a
single-root window implementation.  A new version, vtwm-5.3, is based on the
R5 twm and is available from ftp.x.org. [1/94]

tvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the Tab Window
Manager and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of
swm. It is available on ftp.x.org and mirroring archive servers. The current
[3/95] version is available at
ftp.x.org:/contrib/window_managers/tvtwm.pl11.tar.gz.

olvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is available on
archive servers; version 4.1 [2/94] is on ftp.x.org.

mvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version is
floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a
source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].

NCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look

XDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals is simple
but full-featured.

ctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 twm
offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm and also offers the
window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm. Version 3.1 [2/94] source is on
ftp.x.org; 3.2.p1 [1/95] source is on sunsite.unc.edu.

vuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.  SAIC
offers a version of this VUE environment.

4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM

piewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus

pmwm: IXI's Panorama version of MWM offers olvwm-like features.  Info: +44
223 236 555, +1 408 427 7700; mmoore@x.co.uk or michaela@x.co.uk or
laurie@ixi.com.

fvwm: this virtual window manager has been rewritten from scratch and is very
light on system resources (between half and two-thirds the memory usage of
twm, on which it was based). fvwm offers most of the features others provide,
plus additional features. Source is available from sunsite.unc.edu in
/pub/Linux/X11/window-managers/; fvwm-1.24r-source.tar.z was current in
1/95. Information: http://neutrino.nuc.berkeley.edu/neutronics/todd/fvwm.html.

mwm 2.0: the 2.0 version of mwm includes support for multiple workspaces.

9wm, by David Hogan (dhog@cs.su.oz.au), is an X window manager which attempts
to emulate the Plan 9 window manager 8-1/2 as far as possible within the
constraints imposed by X.  The latest version of 9wm is held at
ftp://ftp.cs.su.oz.au/dhog/9wm.

mwfm: MWFM is a Microsoft-Windows-Program-Manager-style applications
manager.  It offers Unix users the ability to work in a MS-Windows-like
environment.  Sources are at ftp.x.org:contrib/desktop_managers/mwfm1.0.tar.Z

Also of possible use is vr, by Richard Mauri (rmauri@netcom.com), on
ftp.x.org and ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de
(pub/comp/X11/contrib/clients/vr/vr-1.01.tar.Z); Vr is a workspace manager
intended to be window-manager-independent.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  16)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?

	It needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your
window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X
session runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your
window manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager
in the background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:
		exec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic
or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.  Your
X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, whether or
not you kill or restart your window manager.
	Alternatively, there is a chance that you are using OpenLook, which by
default kills all clients on logging out. Change your Exit menu choice from
EXIT to WMEXIT to correct this behavior.
