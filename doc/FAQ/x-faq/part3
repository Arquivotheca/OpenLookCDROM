Subject:  53)  Where can I find a dictionary server for xwebster?

	Webster's still owns the copyright to the on-line copies of Webster's
Dictionary which are found at various (university) sites. After it became
aware that these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running
xwebster and gnuemacs-webster, it asked that server sites close off external
access.
	[The NeXT machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary.
	A Webster daemon for NeXT machines is available from
iuvax.cs.indiana.edu (129.79.254.192) in "pub/webster/NeXT-2.0".]
	Unless you want to get a legal on-line copy yourself or can find a
site which can grant you access, you are probably out of luck.

	However, if you are a legitimate site, you'll want to pick up the
latest xwebster, as-is on ftp.x.org:contrib/xwebster.tar.Z [10/91]; the file
xwebster.README includes discussions of the availability, illegality, and
non-availability of dictionary servers.

Subject:  54)  TOPIC: OBTAINING X AND RELATED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  55)  Is X public-domain software?

	No. The X software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not
"public domain", which has a specific legal meaning. However, the X
distribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee.
	Contributed software, though, may be placed in the public domain by
individual authors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  56)  How compatible are X11R3, R4, R5, R6? What changes are there?

The Release Notes for each release of X11 specify the changes from the
previous release.  The X Consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility
across releases.  In the few places where incompatible changes were necessary,
details are given in the Release Notes.  Each X11 distribution site on the
network also offers the Release Notes that go with the release they offer; the
file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree.

[Stephen Gildea, 1/92]

Things that are incompatible in R6:
	- R6 Xt requires R6 Xlib.
	- R6 Xaw no longer has Clock, Logo, and Mailbox widgets.
	- R6 Xt retains binary compatibility with R5 for all data
	 structures except WMShellPart.  See section 13.4 of the Xt
	 specification for more details.
[Dave Wiggins (dpw@x.org)]

The comp.windows.x.intrinsics FAQ-Xt lists Xt differences among these
versions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  57)! What is Fresco? When is Fresco rumored to be available?

Fresco is a user-interface system specified in CORBA IDL.  The sample
implementation from the X Consortium is implemented in C++.  Fresco is
available with X11R6 ( Fresco doesn't require R6, but it does need the R6
imake to build), but as a work-in-progress. There is no schedule for a full
release version; the Consortium is still charting future directions.

	Fresco is a fairly long-term effort in our [that is, of the X
	Consortium] minds, in part due to the amount of work needed to
	produce a complete next generation user interface system, and in part
	due to the limited number of people working on it.  We expect that
	each subsequent release of Fresco will both deepen coverage in
	previously existing areas like graphics, and broaden coverage to new
	areas like GUI control objects, embedding, and transcription.  What
	order these things appear in, and the schedule for future releases,
	is still somewhat up in the air.
		- Matt Landau, 10/19/94

Fresco draws several design ideas from InterViews and will ultimately
incorporate much of the functionality of Xt and Xlib, and add some
significant new capabilities in the areas of structured graphics, device and
resolution independent drawing models, a standard object model (OMG CORBA)
and interface definition language (CORBA IDL), and application linking and
embedding.

There is a writeup on Fresco in the Proceedings of the 7th Annual X Technical
Conference, published in Issue 5 of the X Resource, O'Reilly and Associates,
ISBN 1-56592-020-1.

PostScript for Mark Linton's Xhibition94 tutorial notes is in
graphics/fresco/xhibition94.ps.Z on ftp.sgi.com.

[Information from Kaleb Keithley (kaleb@x.org) and Matt Landau (matt@x.org); 
1/94; 4/94.]

There is a Fresco home page at http://www.faslab.com/fresco/HomePage.html.

Sources and binaries are available at ftp://ftp.faslab.com/pub/Fresco.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  58)  Does Fresco work with g++ 2.5.8?

No; g++ does not cope with the use of explicitly-scoped nested type names as
formal parameter types of return types for member functions.  For example,
the following class definition will not compile with g++:

        class Event {
        public:
            typedef void *Data;

            Event::Data get_data(void);
            int set_data(Event::Data new_data);
        };

Cygnus is aware of this problem and claims it's fixed in the next release of
g++.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  59)! Where can I get X11R6 (source and/or binaries)?

Release 6 was made available to the public on May 2, 1994.
  
The X Consortium is making R6 available simultaneously on multiple ftp sites
around the world; the Consortium is also offering R6 on CD-ROM, QIC-150 tape,
and 8mm tape (tar format) and is distributing hardcopy documentation.
Information: X Consortium, R6 Sales Center, 1 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA
02142-1301, USA.

You will need about 140Mb of disk space to hold all of the Core distribution.

PLEASE use a site that is close to you in the network.

Note: this list is better available through:
	http://www.x.org/consortium/GettingX11R6.html
	(or via ftp from ftp.x.org as GettingR6, or via "send R6 sales" to
		xstuff@x.org)

Subject:  61)  Where can I get XDM's Wraphelp.c ?

X11R5/R6 supports a DES-based form of authorization.  There are several
implementations of the file Wraphelp.c, which may be missing from your
distribution; one is on ftp.psy.uq.oz.au:/pub/X11R5.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  62)  Where can I get patches to X11? 

	The release of new public patches by the X Consortium is announced
in the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.

	Patches themselves are available via ftp from ftp.x.org and from other
sites from which X11 is available. They are now also distributed through the
newsgroup comp.sources.x. Some source re-sellers may be including patches in
their source distributions of X11.

	People without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. Send to 
xstuff@x.org the Subject line
		send fixes #
where # is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.

There are 11 patches for X11R6 (3/95); here are a few complications:

	1) fix-02 is in 5 parts; you need to request "2a", "2b", "2c", "2d", 
and "2e" separately and concatenate them together before applying
	2) fix-03 refers to a separate file of documentation, fix3docs.tar
	3) fix-05 is in two parts, "5a" and "5b"
	4) fix-09 needs a separate file, XHPKeymaps.uu
	5) fix-10 needs a separate file, fix10fonts.Z, which is not available
via the xstuff mail daemon; you can apply just the basic patch in order to 
avoid future failures
	6) fix-11 needs separate files, XFree.uaa through XFree.uaz

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The xstuff server now has 26 patches for X11R5 [11/93].  There will be no more 
patches to X11R5.

	Here are a few complications:
	1) fix 5 is in four parts; you need to request "5a", "5b", "5c" and 
"5d" separately
	2) the file sunGX.uu, which was part of an earlier patch, was 
re-released with patch 7 [note: the file doesn't work with Solaris]
	3) fix 8 is in two parts: "8a" and "8b"
	4) fix 13 is in three parts: "13a", "13b", and "13c"
	5) fix 16 is in two parts: "16a" and "16b"
	6) fix 18 replaces the R5fix-test1 for the X Test Suite, which 
previously was optional
	7) fix 19 also needs PEXlib.tar.Z, which you can obtain from xstuff
by asking for "PEXlib.uu.[1234]".
	8) fix 22 is in 9 parts, "22a" through "22i"

The MIT Software Center, in addition to offering the entire system on tape, is
offering a new tape with public patches 1-23.  Tapes are available in 6250bpi
9-track reel-to-reel and QIC-24 cartridge formats.  Information: +1 617 258

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  63)  What is the xstuff mail-archive?

	The xstuff server is a mail-response program. That means that you mail
it a request, and it mails back the response.  Any of the four possible
commands must be the first word on a line.  The xstuff server reads your
entire message before it does anything, so you can have several different
commands in a single message (unless you ask for help).  The xstuff server
treats the "Subject:" header line just like any other line of the message.

	The archives are organized into a series of directories and
subdirectories.  Each directory has an index, and each subdirectory has an
index. The top-level index gives you an overview of what is in the
subdirectories, and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.

	1) The command "help" or "send help" causes the server to send you a
more detailed version of this help file.
	2) if your message contains a line whose first word is "index", then
the server will send you the top-level index of the contents of the archive.
If there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories,
then the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top-level
index.  For example, you can say "send index fixes" (or "index fixes"). A
message that requests an index cannot request data.
	3) if your message contains a line whose first word is "send", then
	the xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the
line. To name an item, you give its directory and its name. For example
		send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9 
You may issue multiple send requests.
	The xstuff server contains many safeguards to ensure that it is not
monopolized by people asking for large amounts of data. The mailer is set up
so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day. If the work
queue contains more requests than the day's quota, then the unsent files will
not be processed until the next day.  Whenever the mailer is run to send its
day's quota, it sends the requests out shortest-first.
	4) Some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting
return addresses.  If you use such a mailer, you won't get any response.  If
you happen to know an explicit path, you can include a line like
	path foo%bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu or path bar!foo!frotz in the body
	of your message, and the daemon will use it.

	The xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@x.org.  If your
mailer deals in "!" notation, try sending to
{someplace}!mit-eddie!x.org!xstuff.

Subject:  64)- Where can I get X11R4 (source and binaries)?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  65)  Where can I get OSF/Motif?
	
	You can obtain either OSF/Motif source or binaries from a number of 
vendors. 
	Motif 1.2.5 source is now available; it is based on X11R5. Motif 2.0 is
also available; it, too, is based on X11R5.
	Motif 1.1 is based on the R4.18 Intrinsics and is finished [7/92] at 
1.1.5.
	A conformant Motif implementation not based on OSF-derived source is
being developed by fox@crisp.demon.co.uk (Paul Fox).
	An OSF/Motif source license must be obtained from OSF before source can
be obtained from the Open Software Foundation or any value-added vendor for
any version. Call the Direct Channels Desk at OSF at 617-621-7300 for ordering 
information.

	Various hardware vendors produce developer's toolkits of binaries, 
header files, and documentation; check your hardware vendor, particularly if
that vendor is an OSF member. 
	In addition, independent binary vendors produce Motif toolkits for
machines for which Motif is not supported by a vendor; the kits include varied 
levels of bug-fixing and support for shared libraries and are based on widely
divergent version of Motif:
	Quest Windows (408-496-1900) sells kits for Suns, as well; 
	IXI (+44 1223 518000, +1-408-427-7700) offers kits for Sun3 and Sun4. 
	NSL (+33 (1) 43 36 77 50; requests@nsl.fr) offers kits for the Sun 3 
and Sun 4.
	Bluestone Consulting, Inc. (609-727-4600) offers Motif 1.1.5 & 1.2 for 
SunOS, and Motif 1.2 (X11R5) for Solaris 2.1 & 2.2.
	ICS (617-621-0060) makes several binary kits, notably for Sun, DEC.
	HP and DEC have announced support for Motif on Sun systems.
	Unipalm (+44-954-211-797) currently offers for Sun systems a Motif 
Development Kit including X11R4 and based on Motif 1.1.2. The US distributor is
Expert Object Corp (708-926-8500).
	BIM ships Motif 1.1 binaries for Suns. Shared library support is 
included. Contact Alain Vermeiren (av@sunbim.be) or Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be) 
at +32(2)759.59.25 (Fax : +32(2)759.47.95) (Belgium).
	SILOGIC (+33 61.57.95.95) ships Motif 1.2 and Motif 1.1 on Sun 
machines.
	S.I. Systems offers Motif 1.2 for Solaris 2.1; info: 1-800-755-8649 in
USA and Canada.
	Metro Link, Inc. (+1 305-938-0283, sales@metrolink.com) ships X11R5
and Motif 1.2.2 (including a sharable libXm.a) for the 386/486 Unix market.
Motif 1.2.3 is also available for QNX, SunOS, Solaris Sparc, and Linux.
	in GmbH  (+49 7531 65022, gvr@in-gmbh.de) offers development and user 
kits for SunOS and Solaris.
	OSF/Motif 2.0 binaries for Linux are available from Soft*Star
(fax +39-11-746487, softstar@pol88a.polito.it).

	LessTif will be a complete drop in replacement for OSF/Motif 1.2. It
is currently under development.  The URL for information regarding LessTif,
and a link to the current snapshot, is:
http://www.cs.uidaho.edu:8000/hungry/microshaft/lesstif.html.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  66)  Does Motif work with X11R4? X11R5?

	Motif 1.2 is based on X11R5.
	Motif 1.1, available in source form from OSF as of August 1990, uses 
the "vanilla" X11R4 Intrinsics, where "vanilla" means "with just a few
patches"; the file fix-osf which OSF distributes is obsoleted by the
Consortium's patches 15-17.  The file fix-osf-1.1.1 distributed with the
1.1.1 version or its subsequent modification needs to be applied after fix-18, 
though.

	Motif 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 will work with X11R5 if X11R5 is compiled with
-DMOTIFBC; 1.1.4 and later should work with the vanilla R5, although there are 
some known new geometry-management problems.
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------

sample server on the HP 9000 Series 700 workstations; the files are on
ftp.x.org in ~ftp/contrib/R5.HP.SRV. [8/92]

have created an on-line index of public domain X software. The index is
available through gopher and provides an index of the ftp.x.org/contrib
archive, the comp.sources.x archive and various X software found around the
internet. The service holds manual pages, README files , etc which can be
browsed through. A keyword search of the manual pages is also provided.
Information: xindex@castle.edinburgh.ac.uk.

	User-contributed software is distributed through the newsgroup
comp.sources.x, moderated by Chris Olson (chris@imd.sterling.com); also check 
that group for posting information.

	Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) has been creating a list of freely-
available X sources.  The list is stored on ftp.x.org in contrib as
x-source-list.Z. It lists the main storage locations for the program and 
international sites from which it may be ftp'ed.

	The machine ftp.x.org has a great deal of user-contributed software in 
the contrib/ directory; a good deal of it is present in current or earlier
versions on the X11R3, X11R4, and X11R5 contrib tapes. There are also
directories for fixes to contrib software.  The file on ftp.x.org in
contrib/0ftpxorg.dir.Z is a quick overall index of the software in that area,
provided by Daniel Lewart (d-lewart@uiuc.edu).

	These sites used to and may still mirror ftp.x.org and are of particular 
use for Australasia: Anonymous ftp: ftp.Adelaide.EDU.AU; ACSnet Fetchfile: 
sirius.ua.oz.

	The material on giza.cis.ohio-state.edu, which tends to duplicate 
the ftp.x.org archives, is also available via anonymous UUCP from osu-cis, at
TB+ and V.32 speeds.  Write to uucp@cis.ohio-state.edu (same as osu-cis!uucp)
for instructions. [the archive is now maintained by Karl Kleinpaste]

	A new west-coast UUCP X11 Archive is administered by Mark Snitily 
(mark@zok.uucp) and contains the full X11 distribution, the XTEST
distribution, an entire archive of comp.sources.x and other goodies.
	The machine zok has a TB+ modem which will connect to 19.2K, 2400, 
1200 baud (in that order).  The anonymous UUCP account is UXarch with password 
Xgoodies.  The modem's phone number is 408-996-8285.
	A sample Systems (or L.sys) entry might be:
   		zok Any ACU 19200 4089968285 in:--in: UXarch word: Xgoodies
	To get a current listing of the files that are available, download
the file "/usrX/ls-lR.Z".
	A full subject index of the comp.sources.x files is available in the
file "/usrX/comp.sources.x/INDEX".
	The machine has just the one modem, so please do not fetch large 
amounts of data at one sitting.

In addition, UUNET Source Archives (703-876-5050) tracks comp.sources.x and 
provides 800MB+ of compressed programs on 6250 bpi tapes or 1/4" tapes.  It 
also mirrors ftp.x.org/contrib in its packages/X directory.
