Sun DeskSet is the collection of tools you get with OpenWindows;
some of these are being ported to Motif for COSE/CDE: cm, mailtool, maybe
others.

[1] What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere?
[2] What can I put in my .ttysrc?	 Where is it documented?
[3] Is there a tty-based interface to cm (Calendar Manager)?
[4] How can I arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail?

[1] What are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere?

    See the man page for textedit(1) for some of them.
    In general, the editing/moving commands go in the opposite direction when
    shifted - e.g. Ctrl+w deletes a word, and Ctrl+W deletes the word to the
    right of the insert point.

	Meta-i - include file	    Meta-f - find selection (forward/backward)

	Ctrl-a - start of line	    Ctrl-< - back word
	Ctrl-e - end of line	    Ctrl-> - forward word
	Ctrl-w - delete word	    Ctrl-u - delete to start/END of line
	Ctrl-Return - move to end/START of document

    See the O'Reilly XView Reference Manual for a list of some of the default
    keys; see also the olwm or olvwm manual page.

[2] What can I put in my .ttysrc?	 Where is it documented?

    See the manual page for shelltool.

Subject: DeskSet, Mailtool, Calendar Manager, etc.

[3] Is there a tty-based interface to cm (Calendar Manager)?
    Yes, cm_delete, cm_insert and cm_lookup; these all have manual pages.
    If "man cm_delete" doesn't work or gives strange messages, see under
    Trouble Shooting: Strange Error Messages, below.

    On Solaris 2.3, cm_lookup may be broken (and maybe cm_delete & cm_insert
    are too), as it always uses a date in 1970 if you give it an invalid date.
    The Solaris 2.2 and 2.4 ones seem more tolerant of date formats.

[4] How can I arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail?
    The best way is:
    $ cd
    $ cp /usr/lib/.textswrc .
    $ chmod +w .textswrc
    edit .textswrc (use vi, textedit, or whatever you prefer)
    add the follwing:
	KEY_RIGHT(3)    FILTER
	cat ~/.signature
    (you might need to change ~ to $HOME)

    Now pressing R3 will insert your .signature file.
