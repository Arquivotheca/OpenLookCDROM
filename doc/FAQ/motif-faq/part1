Motif FAQ

[Last changed: 05 MAY 95]

This article contains the answers to some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 
often seen in comp.windows.x.motif. It is posted to help reduce volume in 
this newsgroup and to provide hard-to-find information of general interest.

		     Please redistribute this article!

This FAQ is maintained by Ken Sall (ksall@cen.com) of Century Computing, Inc.  

      http://www.cen.com/

I also maintain a WWW page called "MW3: Motif on the World Wide Web" at:

      http://www.cen.com/mw3/

Send FAQ and MW3 updates and corrections to ksall@cen.com.  It would help if 
the subject line contained the phrase "For Motif FAQ".  I will be making an
HTML version available sometime in the future. In the meantime, World Wide 
Web'sters are directed to the automatically generated HTML version of this
FAQ at the URL:

      http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/motif-faq/top.html

There is also a WAIS database of FAQs which you can search :

      http://www.cs.ruu.nl/cgi-bin/faqwais

This is particularly useful since it's possible the answer you're looking for 
is in another FAQ (X, Xt, Widgets FAQ, etc.)

*** PLEASE NOTE ***
If you don't understand the above "http://" notation, see the subject:
"What is an URL?" 

In some cases, I've repeated information in different contexts to make
these details a bit easier to find.

This article includes answers to the questions listed below. Key:

                + questions NEW to this issue;
                * CHANGES since last issue.

*** CAVEAT ***

If an answer does not have a "Last modified" date, it's possible the 
information may no longer be accurate. Modification dates go back to 
August 1992.  More than half the answers have such a modification date. 
Note also that the older the "Last modified" date, the more likely 
the information may be suspect. Pay close attention to version 
information discussed in answers, since the information may pertain 
only to that specific release.

Subject:  1)  TOPIC: WHAT IS MOTIF?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  2)  What is Motif and how does it relate to the X Toolkit and X
Window System?


[Last modified: Feb 95]

Answer:

Motif is a widely-accepted set of user interface guidelines developed by the
Open Software Foundation (OSF) around 1989 which specifies how an X Window
System application should "look and feel". OSF/Motif, as it's more formally
called, includes the Motif Toolkit (also called "Xm" or the "Motif widgets"),
which enforce a policy on top of the X Toolkit Intrinsics ("Xt"). Xt is really
a "mechanism not policy" layer, and Xm provides the specific "look and feel".
For example, Xt does not insist that windows have titlebars or menus, but it
provides hooks for developers of specific toolkits (Motif, OpenLook, Athena
widgets) to take advantage of. In addition to widgets, OSF/Motif includes the
Motif Style Guide document (as well as several others listed in my FAQ) which
details how a Motif user interface should look and behave to be "Motif
compliant".

The X Toolkit Intrinsics are built upon the lowest programming level API
called "Xlib" (X library). Both Xlib and Xt are specified by the X Consortium
(formerly called the MIT X Consortium), which you can reach at:
        http://www.x.org/ or:
        ftp to ftp.x.org

Xlib and Xt source code is free. Motif is not.

Subject:  3)  TOPIC: OTHER RELEVANT NEWSGROUPS

[Last modified: Feb 95]

Answer: This newsgroup is comp.windows.x.motif.  The WWW URL is:

        news:comp.windows.x.motif


The nearest related group is comp.windows.x.  It also maintains an FAQ, which
deals in all sorts of X, Xlib and Xt questions. Look there for answers to
questions such as "How do I get a screendump of my application?", "where do I
get X11R4,X11R5, X11R6", etc.  The URLs for other groups which may have
relevant information are:

        news:comp.windows.x.pex
        news:comp.windows.x.apps
        news:comp.windows.x.intrinsics
        news:comp.windows.news
        news:comp.windows.misc
        news:comp.windows.open-look
        news:alt.windows.cde


The intrinsics and open-look groups also have an FAQ.

The newsgroup news.answers contains *lots* of FAQs (including this one).  Look
there for lots of info on everything.

The Motif FAQ is available in 6 parts via anonymous ftp in any of the
following directories at rtfm.mit.edu:

        /pub/usenet-by-group/comp.windows.x.motif
        /pub/usenet-by-group/comp.answers/motif-faq
        /pub/usenet-by-group/news.answers/motif-faq


There is also a mail server called mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu.  To retrieve a
file send mail to the server with a subject or body similar to

        send usenet/comp.windows.x.motif/Motif_FAQ_(Part_1_of_6).Z

Subject:  7)  What is an URL? Are "ftp://", "http://", and "gopher://" typos?

[Last modified: Oct 94]

Answer: No, they are not typos.  All location references in this FAQ are
slowly being replaced with WWW (World Wide Web) URLs (Uniform Resource
Locator). Basically, an URL is a unique location of a Web resource (directory,
file, image, host, etc.). If you want to read more about URL's, get the
PostScript paper from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu:

        Mosaic/mosaic-papers/getting-started.ps

If you don't know how to access the Web, you can still access locations via
anonymous ftp by dropping the "ftp://" protocol portion and interpreting the
next section as the domain name. For example, for an URL of

        ftp://any.old.place/dirname/filename

connect via anonymous ftp to any.old.place and get /dirname/filename.

Similarly, if the location begins "gopher://", drop the protocol portion,
telnet to the host and login as "gopher".

If the location in this FAQ begins with "http://" and you aren't a Web user,
simply ignore the reference. Or, you could check out the WWW FAQ (2 or more
parts) from rtfm.mit.edu directory:

         /pub/usenet/news.answers/www/faq

Why are URLs being used? For those who regularly access the Web (via browsers
such as Mosaic, WinWeb, Chimera, Lynx, W3, tkWWW, etc.), this notation greatly
facilitates access to the cited documents/directories/files. And, for this FAQ
maintainer, URLs make it easier to verify whether the pointer is still
accurate! Instead of typing:

        ftp any.old.place
        logging in as anonymous
        entering my email address
        cd /dirname
        get filename

I can simply use the "Open URL" feature of my browser and paste
"ftp://any.old.place/dirname/filename" in one step. 'Nuff said!

Subject: 14)  What versions of Motif are there?

[Last modified: Sept 94]

Answer: Motif 1.0 is based on the R3 toolkit.  There are patch releases to
1.0: 1.0.1, 1.0.A, 1.0.2 and 1.0.3, 1.0.4, 1.0.5. 1.0.A was a fairly major
patch, as it involved a complete re-engineering of UIL and Mrm.  Almost
everyone who has 1.0.x has either 1.0.A or 1.0.3.

Motif 1.1 is based on the R4 toolkit.  The intial version was Motif 1.1.0.
Motif 1.1.1 has been released as a patch to licensees with Full Support or
Technical Update service.  Motif 1.1.2 is a patch release which contains the
necessary changes to fix over 80 bugs reported against Motif. It is available
to support contract holders (including both full support and update service).
The 1.1.3 release fixed a further 150 bugs and was available from August 1991
to support contract holders (including both full support and update service).
1.1.4 offers X11R5 support, but is not an X11R5 product.  1.1.5 was released
in June 92 to licensees who hold a Motif Full Support or Update Support
contract

Motif 1.2.0 was released in April 1992 and is based on the X11R5 toolkit.  It
offers increased compatibility with international standards,  PC-style
behavior and binary compatibility with OSF/Motif 1.1 applications.  New
features include drag-and-drop, tear- off menus, toolkit enhancements and new
documentation.  toolkit.  The code is totally ANSI C.  OSF distributes a 10
pages sheet entitled "OSF/Motif R1.1 to R1.2: detailed overview of changes",
which is available from OSF Motif direct channels.  (617-621-7300 or email
direct@osf.org)

Motif 1.2.1 was released September 92.  Due to an optimisation from 1.2.0 to
1.2.1 object code compiled under 1.2.1 (that is, using 1.2.1 header files)
will not link with 1.2.0 libraries (and, very probably, clients that use
shared libraries and are linked against 1.2.1 won't startup against 1.2).

Motif 1.2.2 was released March 93.  This release contains over 250 bug fixes,
improved text, drag-and-drop features and has less than one reported defect
per 1000 lines of code.

from dbrooks@osf.org Motif 1.2.3 was released on September 13, 1993.  The
defect density is measured at < 0.8 known reports per thousand lines.  In this
release, we have paid particular attention to memory leaks, and have improved
drag-and-drop performance greatly.

Motif 1.2.4 was released April '94.  from the OSF README: This patch release
contains approximately 240 bug fixes for Motif 1.2. The number of CRs resolved
in this release is about 330....Apart from the 64-bit changes, all changes
made in this release are fixes for reported bugs.

Motif 2.0 was released in August '94.

The following was composed by one of our business managers, Darrell Crow
(crow@osf.org),  questions may be directed to him.

----------------------------------------

With this posting I hope to answer many questions I've been receiving
regarding what is in Motif 2.0 and how does if differ from Release 1.2.  This
posting contains an overview followed by a bullet item listing of the features
and benefits added to Motif in this release. If I didn't answer your questions
feel free to direct them to me.  At the end, I'll list additional
documentation available from OSF.  If you're also interested in the licensing
and pricing information you can also contact me or the official OSF/Motif
channel: direct@osf.org.  I hope that this information update is of benefit to
you.

OSF/Motif has become the major Graphical User Interface (GUI) technology for
Open Systems, as well as an IEEE 1295 standard.  On Tuesday, June 21, OSF
announced its next major release of OSF/Motif, Release 2.0.   This release,
which is the most extensive and colaborative release of Motif since Motif 1.0
was introduced five years ago, includes new features organized around four
major themes:
        I.  Extensibility,
        2.  Consistency,
        3.  Improvements and
        4.  CDE Convergence.

Motif 2.0 was a collaborative development effort.  Contributors to this
release include Lotus Development, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Digital Equipment,
Integrated Computer Solutions, Computer Automation,  Groupe Bull, HaL Computer
Systems and Unix Systems Laboratories.

This release had the goal of allowing developers to easily build new widgets
and with support for C++ .  This required new extensible features such as
subclassing, traits, C++ support and detailed documentation.  Like all Xt-
based toolkits, subclassing requires detailed knowledge, experience and access
to the source code to fully understand Motif's class methods.  Motif 2.0
simplified this process by providing extensive documentation and allowing
subclassing from the Primitive and Manager classes without requiring access to
source code. Documentation of Motif's class methods are included in a new
book, The OSF/Motif Widget Writer's Guide. This book provides all necessary
information to subclass from Primitive and Manager and numerous examples of
subclassing are provided.   Traits are a new feature with Motif 2.0 which
essentially allow a given behaviour to be associated to a widget irrespective
of the widget hierarchial relationships. The number of applications developped
in C++ is rapidly growing and C++ programmers are now able to derive new
subclasses and still have those C++ widgets usable as regular widgets with the
standard API in Motif 2.0

CDE (Common Desktop Environment) convergence.  The previous version of
OSF/Motif (Release 1.2) introduced major new features such as
internationalization, drag-and-drop and tear-off menus. Those features were
intended to allow application developers to produce interoperable, easy to use
applications for a worldwide market. As a result, this technology was selected
to become the basis of the Common Desktop Environment jointly developed by HP,
IBM, Novell and SunSoft, proposed to become an X/Open standard. These features
as well as the GUI extensions added to the CDE specifications have been added
to Release 2.0.

PC Consistency has been a major theme of this release.  This includes
improvements and completions to the toolkit that was begun with Motif 1.2 as
well as the addition of seven new widgets (Container, Notebook, icon gadget,
spinbox, combobox, CSText and thermometer) common to this environment and
finally a new Style Guide.  Extensive work has been expended to ensure the
convergence of the Windows, CUA, CDE and Motif style both in technology and
terminology into a single document.  The work for this book will be submitted
to the X/Open Fast Track process for incorporation into the X/Open set of
specifications.

Improvements to the OSF/Motif toolkit are far too numerous to adequately list
here.  However a brief mention of a few of the major improvements includes the
addition of the Unified Transfer Model that simplifies data transfer by all
Motif's previous methods,  XPM support (ability to read colored icon file for
pixmap resources), ScrolledWindow partial scroll and autodrag,Toggle
checkmark, indeterminate state, documenting the input methods API for
internationalization, upgrading UIL to support 64-bit architecture, platform
independence, and support of the new extensibility features and widgets, and
finally the Motif Window Manager support of virtual screen, workspace
management protocol and root menu additions and etc.

This release brings together the most requested features from development
community with the single purpose of extending application developers' mission
of producing portable, consistent and interoperable applications to the open
systems  community.

Subject: 18)* Where can I get Motif?

[Last modified: May 95]

Answer:
    Various hardware vendors produce developer's toolkits of binaries, header
files, and documentation; check your hardware vendor, particularly if that
vendor is an OSF member.

    In addition, independent binary vendors produce Motif toolkits.

[A FAQ is not for "personal opinions" on these toolkits.  I don't think it is
appropriate to give such opinions through this particular posting, so I
haven't included any.]

Subject: 19)  Is there a list of Motif bugs?

Answer: With each patch release of Motif shipped, there is a list of known
bugs provided.  The filename on the tape is "./OPENBUGS".  There is also a
list of all the issues closed/resolved in that patch.  That is found as part
of the "./README-1.1.n" (where n is the patch number) file.

These are the only OSF published lists.

No one else seems to publish a list.

Subject: 21)  What is COSE and how does it relate to Motif?

[Last modified: Sept 94]

Answer:

        NOTE: This info dates back to a Nov. '93 conference.
        Most of the words should be credited to the lecturer,
        Nicholas J. Aiuto (nick@ps.quotron.com) of Cadence Design Systems, Inc.
        Any mistakes or inaccuracies are mine, however.
        I would appreciate updates and corrections...ksall@cen.com


COSE is Common Open Software Environment, a major interoperability effort
started by HP, Sun, Novell/UNIX System Labs (USL), IBM, and SCO, with over 70
other companies pledging their support. The COSE announcement was made in
March, 1993 and a "COSE CDE Conference" was held in San Jose in October, 1993.

CDE is the Common Desktop Environment component of COSE. CDE is "a
specification for components and services to give the UNIX desktop common and
consistent capabilities like those found in other widely used environments
(Mac, Windows)." [from class notes] CDE is not public domain; it will be
provided by major vendors, possibly at extra cost as unbundled s/w
approximately mid 1994.  CDE will be based on Motif 1.2 and X11R5, although
Motif 2.0 and X11R6 are expected around the same time. (CDE will be ported to
Motif 2.0 eventually.)

A CD-ROM was distributed at the October, 1993 conference, but this was "alpha"
s/w, strictly for evaluation purposes, not for development.

Another COSE/CDE Snapshot CD-ROM was released in April '94, available for HP,
IBM, Novell, and Sun platforms.

Overview
--------

Standards are to be defined in these areas:

        - desktop
        - networking
        - objects
        - graphics
        - system management

CDE Functional Groups:

    High Level:
        - Desktop Management
        - Productivity Tools

    Low Level:
        - GUI Display and Printing
        - Application Integration
        - "Guidelines": a 100+ pg. checklist which is a superset of Motif's

CDE Desktop Management
----------------------

 - Login Manager: like xdm
 - Session Manager: saving state based on ICCCM and HP's VUE [vuesession]
 - Workspace Manager: virtual screens; rooms; virtual win mgr
 - Front Panel: object and window management; access to favorite apps
 - File Manager: icon drag and drop
 - Application Manager
 - Style Manager: configure Session Mgr (colors, fonts, HOME session)

Productivity Tools
------------------

 - Text Editor: based on XmText widget; not very fancy
 - Icon Editor: color pixmaps; based on HP's vueicon; need 16 icons per app
 - Help Viewer: can access app help without running application
 - Mailer and Calendar: can talk to each other
 - Terminal Emulator: improvement on xterm
 - Calculator
 - Create "Action": something you tell your system to do and associate with
                   a specific icon (e.g., starting a favorite app); can also
                   tag a specific command line and add to your desktop

GUI Display and Printing
------------------------

 - Motif 1.2 with extras, X11R5
 - New widgets (subclasses of similar widgets to be in Motif 2.0):
        o  ComboBox
        o  SpinButton

 - dtksh: windowing Korn shell, a robust UNIX shell interface to X, Xlib, and
Xm
 - Application Builder: port of Sun's DevGuide [not yet available]
 - X Print Server and X Server Print Extension

Application Integration
-----------------------

 - Data Interchange
        o  Drag and Drop (DND): based on Motif 1.2 with improvements
        o  Bento container format:
                "Japanese lunchbox"
                compartmented container developed by Apple;
                stores compound document on disk;
                apps can find audio compartment, for example
                100-page document describes Bento
 - ToolTalk
        o  messaging/IPC facility developed by Sun
        o  CDE message sets (sample msgsd: iconify yourself, close down, etc.)
 - Actions
        o define what can be done with files or arbitrary data (e.g., audio)
 - Data Typing
        o define data classes for objects (e.g., PS file, C source code)

Guidelines
----------

 - Common Fonts (about 16): proportional, monospaced, with or without serif
 - Internationalization (I18N) compliance
 - Client/Server
        o Network execution model
        o end user model
        o system admin model: facilitates easy installation of new
                              CDE-compliant apps
        o ISV model
 - Certification Checklist: 100 pages; superset of Motif 1.2 Certif. Checklist

Subject: 23)  What is PST?

[Last modified: Dec 94]

A.  Kristen Knotts <uunet!osf.org!kjk> writes:

PST stands for Pre-structured Technology.  This is a new process, which
evolved from the 1993 COSE (Common Open Software Environment) initiative, used
by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) to procure and deliver technology to the
industry more quickly than the existing Request For Technology (RFT) process.

For more information on OSF and its acronyms (e.g., PST, RFT, RFC), contact
OSF Direct (direct@osf.org) or literature-request@osf.org.

Subject: 24)  Does OSF's PST process impact CDE evolution?

[Last modified: Dec 94]

A.  In response to some questions from Marc Prokop (prokop@acri.fr), Elizabeth
Connolly of Open Software Foundation wrote:


You're correct that CDE (1.0) was developed on Motif 1.2.  You're also
correct that OSF included in Motif 2.0 several extensions to Motif 1.2 that
were made by the CDE 1.0 implementors.  Despite OSF's inclusion of these
extensions, OSF is not involved in CDE 1.0 development.

As you may know, OSF has a new process, called the Pre-Structured
Technology (PST) process, for joint development projects.  Further
evolution of both CDE and Motif (that is, beyond CDE 1.0 and Motif 2.0)
is expected to be handled under this process.  In fact, a group of
companies is at work now on a PST proposal for submission to the OSF Board
of Directors.  Such a PST would provide for management of the
"compatibility" between Motif and CDE.

You could acquire more information about CDE 1.0 by querying one of
the companies involved in CDE 1.0 (HP, IBM, Novell, and Sunsoft.)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Subject: 25)  Because of COSE, is Motif now in the public domain?

Answer: The *specification* for Motif is no longer controlled by OSF, but by
X/Open.  This does not affect the *implementation*. The implementation is
still in the hands of OSF, and will not be released into the public domain.
So no, the OSF source code will still only be available to those who buy a
source code license from OSF.

The specification does not include UIL or obsolete features (ie 1.0 bugs in
design), but these will continue to be supported by the OSF code.

Subject: 26)* What is DCE?

[Last modified: May 95]

A.  DCE is an acronym for "Distributed Computing Environment". OSF maintains
an extensive WWW page concerning DCE at:

        http://web1.osf.org:8001/dce/index.html

DCE is defined in "The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing"
(http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/) by Denis Howe <dbh@doc.ic.ac.uk>:

(DCE) An architecture consisting of standard programming interfaces,
conventions and server functionalities (eg. naming, distributed file system,
remote procedure call) for distributing applications transparently across
networks of heterogeneous computers. DCE is promoted and controlled by the
Open Software Foundation (OSF).
