<P>This directory contains a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
news articles from the "news.answers" group.  These files are updated
automatically by a program called "rkive" with the latest posted
versions collected automatically from the USENET news network.</P>
<P>The files are storded using the "Archive-name:" pseudo-header
included in the regular FAQ posting. A few very old FAQs are in
OLD-STYLE; these do not have Archive-name: headers but are considered
worth saving for the nonce.
