Solaris SW list.  Maintained by ric@updike.sri.com.  Ric Steinberger.

Last updated: 09/08/94

Solaris 2.x compatibility information.  Here is an attempt to provide
some information about SW that may run under SUN's Solaris 2.x OS.
Feel free to send additional information regarding other
tools that you would like to see included.  If possible, include details
as to whether that product runs under 2.x [include x].  This list is
now available via anonymous FTP from updike.sri.com.
Please send suggestions to: ric@updike.sri.com.

Use archie or other database to find out where these tools reside.
Most of the GNU programs are on prep.ai.mit.edu.  Many X11 programs
are on export.lcs.mit.edu.  rtfm.mit.edu is a source for many
other programs.  So is ftp.uu.net.

Other FREE SW and DOCS is available via anon FTP from opcom.canada.sun.ca.
Files are also available via EMAIL: Send a message to ftp@opcom.canada.sun.ca.
"help" should be in the subject line.
Hooray for The Great White North!

Also: The ftp directory camus.quintus.com:pub/GNU contains various GNU
programs for Solaris2.X running on sparc. These are packaged to enable
installation using pkgadd.
Included GNU emacs, GNU gcc, Perl and GNU tools (and gunzip).
[NOTE: If you are installing Solaris on a "new" set of machines and don't
yet have any GNU-type software installed, this may be the fastest way
to get a reasonable set of binaries installed.  You can build all of these
from source at a later time.]

Also 2: Binaries for TeX, MF, LaTeX, dvips, xdvi, etc are available on:
cs.ucr.edu:/pub/solaris/tex-binaries/tex-sol2.3.tar.gz
You will need 14 megs of disk space and make both a user tex
and group tex.  Please see the README file for more information.

Additional Solaris SW sites include: sunsite.unc.edu [sample drivers, API
documents, white papers].

I will usually only list a site if a "customized" 2.x-compatible version or
patches exist there.  [I would prefer not to get in the business of
listing distribution sites, as they tend to be very volatile entities.]

Note: Unless otherwise indicated, "builds" means compiles using SUN-supplied
compilers.  Many utilities/programs compile with gcc or Sun C.

IMPORTANT: If you have built a tool/utility listed here and you needed to
apply one or more patches, PLEASE contact the code's author so that
he/she may examine you efforts and incorporate them into the next release.
This will help everyone.  "HELP SAVE THE WORLD." - Larry Wall.

NOTICE: I am trying to establish an effective method to indicate
which version of Solaris is required (i.e., 2.0 or 2.1).  Presumably
some SW will only build/run on later versions of Solaris.

CAVEAT: The listing of a program/product below does NOT mean that I have
personally compiled or tested it.  The information in this list is
supplied to me by users like yourself.  I will attempt to keep this
list accurate and reasonably up to date, but I depend on YOU to help me
do this.  If you see something that is incomplete or inaccurate, please
try to obtain correct information and then contact me.


Status Codes:

1 Current distribution builds under Solaris 2.0 and above.
2 Current distribution builds with patches.  [See comments]
  [Most people who claimed that they we able to get XXX to build with
   only a "few" patches have generally been optimistic about others
   ability to do the same.  However this is not necessarily the case.]
3 Current distribution doesn't build yet.
4 Partial build. [See comments]
5 Cygnus distribution includes this.  See vendor/cygnus dir on ftp.uu.net.
6 Binary available.  Binaries have been posted to some sites known
  by archie and other databases.  It is clearly more desirable to have
  the source build properly, especially for tools that depend on
  significant selection of options prior to a build.
7 Compiles under 4.x compatibility mode.
8 Current distribution builds under Solaris 2.0 and above using gcc.
9 
10 Current distribution builds with Solaris 2.1 and later
11 Current distribution builds with Solaris 2.2 and later

Note 1: 
I managed to get NNTP RN 4.4.3 to compile, after much work.  This also means
I got the library parts of CNEWS and NNTP to compile.  I don't really
have any patches (and they'd be hard to make), but will answer questions
for people trying to do it themselves.  CNEWS and NNTP aren't too bad.
RN 4.4.3 is in bad shape, mostly because the "Configure" script suffers
from serious brain damage. [From Dave Curry <davy@ecn.purdue.edu>] 1/14/93

Note 2:
The status of X11R5 has changed.  [Message from John DiMarco]
Caspar Dik and myself have put together a comprehensive patch kit for
mit X11R5 pl 19 or greater, supporting both the default MIT code and the
Xsun multi-screen server enhancement by Kaleb Keithley. A GX .o file
in ELF format is also included. Patches for Xview3 and Olit are included.
The patch kit is available on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib and
ra.mcs.anl.gov:/sun-managers as R5.SunOS5.patch.tar.Z
Feel free to contact either myself (jdd@cdf.toronto.edu) or
Casper (casper@fwi.uva.nl) if you need more information.

There are now patches available on export.lcs.mit.edu that make
X11R5 (pl 19-22) run on Solaris 2.1. These patches are a a combination
of patches previously avialble via ftp or usenet and new code.
The patches support MIT R5 pl 19-22 and the R5 multi-screen patch
with that MIT R5 pl 19-22.
The patch is called ``R5.SunOS5.patch.tar.Z'' and includes
support for xview 3.2. Olvwm will build with that release after
including -lm on the link command line.
The minimum requirements are gcc 2.3.3 (first version that properly
supports PIC on Solaris 2.x.
Tested on Solaris 2.1 with adapters cgthree/bwtwo/cgsix.
Includes sunGX.o.elf (ELF code that uses the GX adapter).
See the README for the contributors.

SW from SUN that runs under Solaris 2.0 or later.

[Note: It will be *impossible* to make this a complete list.  I will try
 to include the most "popular" software.  ]

IMPORTANT:  It is getting to be difficult to keep track of the exact
version numbers of SUN products that are available under Solaris 2.0 or
later.  I am making a reasonable attempt to present information I receive
from SUN and from readers of comp.unix.solaris.  Sometimes I have listed
only the latest version number that is claimed to be available.  PLEASE
contact SUN directly if your are uncertain as to what to order.

"Not yet" means that it is coming sooner or later this year and a beta release
may be available for early access developers.

The list of "Other Commercial" is definitely going to be incomplete.  I will
try to include the more popular 3rd party software products.  If a "?"
appears, it means I have no information as to whether this product runs
under Solaris 2.x.  Feel free to contact the vendor and relay any information
back to me.

I have been informed that more complete information about commercial
products is available from Solaris2apps@Sun.Com.  Just send them a 
message and a daemon wil reply.
