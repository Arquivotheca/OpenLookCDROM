Frequently Asked Questions about International Standards with Answers
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This text is a monthly posting to the USENET groups comp.protocols.iso,
comp.std.misc and comp.std.internat. Its purpose is to give answers to
some of the questions appearing most often in these groups and to
collect interesting information about standards that appeared in USENET
discussions.

If you have a suggestion how this text might be improved or have a text
that you would like to be added, please send it to Markus Kuhn
<mskuhn@cip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de>. Contributions, that I can
simply copy into the text are especially welcome. If you can't send
e-mail, you can also send documents or disks/tapes with material relevant
to the FAQ or the ftp archive (ftp.uni-erlangen.de:pub/doc/ISO/)
to Markus Kuhn, Schlehenweg 9, D-91080 Uttenreuth, Germany.

This FAQ is crossposted to news.answers and won't expire there on
well-managed news systems until the next version has been posted. As a
consequence of being crossposted to news.answers, this text will also
be automatically archived on many FAQ servers all over the world
(e.g., look with ftp at server rtfm.mit.edu (login: anonymous) in
/pub/usenet/news.answers/standards-faq). You'll also find there
many other answers to frequently asked questions.

This FAQ is perhaps one of the first that uses an 8-bit character set
on USENET, because there are many non-ASCII characters necessary for a
correct ISO member address list. Nearly the full USENET is 8-bit
transparent, and the character set is announced in the message header
as defined in RFC 1341. If you can't see the right characters then
check your environment (fonts, stty settings, newsreader options,
code pages, ...), because the character set ISO 8859-1 is available on
many computers, but often simply not activated. A few test characters are
ê=e+^, µ=greek mu, ©=copyright sign and ½=fraction 1/2. If you see
j, 5, ) and = instead, then the highest bit has been stripped off.
The portable program iso2asc.c that you'll find with anonymous ftp on
ftp.uni-erlangen.de in pub/doc/ISO/ converts ISO 8859-1 text files
to 7-bit US-ASCII and to IBM PC character set if you can't display
these characters directly.

Don't be angry if anything in this text is incorrect. As with all
information exchanged on USENET, you only get what you pay for and the
current author isn't paid a single pfennig for this FAQ. Better mail
me the correction!

I hope you enjoy it ...

Markus

What are ISO, ITU, CCITT, ANSI, ...?
------------------------------------

Many countries have national standards bodies where experts from
industry and universities develop standards for all kinds of
engineering problems. Among them are, for instance,

     ANSI     American National Standards Institute       USA
     DIN      Deutsches Institut fuer Normung             Germany
     BSI      British Standards Institution               United Kingdom
     AFNOR    Association francaise de normalisation      France
     UNI      Ente Nazionale Italiano di Unificazione     Italy
     NNI      Nederlands Normalisatie-instituut           Netherlands
     SAA      Standards Australia                         Australia
     SANZ     Standards Association of New Zealand        New Zealand
     NSF      Norges Standardiseringsforbund              Norway
     DS       Dansk Standard                              Denmark

and about 80 others.

The International Organization for Standardization, ISO, in Geneva is
the head organization of all these national standardization bodies.
Together with the International Electrotechnical Commission, IEC, ISO
concentrates its efforts on harmonizing national standards all over the
world. The results of these activities are published as ISO standards.
Among them are, for instance, the metric system of units, international
stationery sizes, all kinds of bolt nuts, rules for technical drawings,
electrical connectors, security regulations, computer protocols, file
formats, bicycle components, ID cards, programming languages,
International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN), ... Over 10 000 ISO
standards have been published so far and you surely get in contact with
a lot of things each day that conform to ISO standards you never heard
of. By the way, "ISO" is not an acronym for the organization in any
language. It's a wordplay based on the English initials and the
Greek-derived prefix "iso-" meaning "same".

Within ISO, ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC1) deals with
information technology.

The International Telecommunication Union, ITU, is the United Nations
specialized agency dealing with telecommunications. At present there
are 164 member countries. One of its previous bodies was the
International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee, CCITT,
which is now after an organizational reorganization of ITU called
ITU-T (Telecommunication Standardization Sector). A Plenary Assembly
of the CCITT/ITU-T, which takes place every few years, draws up a list
of 'Questions' about possible improvements in international electronic
communication. In Study Groups, experts from different countries
develop 'Recommendations' which are published after they have been
adopted. Especially relevant to computing are the ITU-T V series of
recommendations on modems (e.g. V.32, V.42), the X series on data
networks and OSI (e.g. X.25, X.400), the I and Q series that define
ISDN, the Z series that defines specification and programming
languages (SDL, CHILL), the T series on text communication (teletex,
fax, videotext, ODA) and the H series on digital sound and video
encoding. The previous CCIR (International Radio Consultative
Committee and the IFBR (International Frequency Registration Board)
are now called ITU-R (Radiocommunication Sector). The previous BDT
(Telecommunications Development Bureau) is know called ITU-D.

The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) adopts international
and national standards with the effect that all member bodies have to
withdraw contradicting material (e.g., ISO 9000 to 9004 were adopted
as EN 29 000 to 29 004). Regional standardization bodies are
mentioned in ISO/IEC Guides, and CEN seems to be the only one.

Since 1961, the European Computer Manufacturers Association, ECMA, has
been a forum for data processing experts where agreements have been
prepared and submitted for standardization to ISO, ITU and other
standards organizations.

Internet standards are developed for protocol-based interoperability.
They are developed under two broad categories of responsibility:
strategic concerns are handled by the Internet Society (ISOC) and the
Internet Architecture Board (IAB), and technical development by the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Research Task
Force (IRTF).  ISOC is an incorporated, international, non-profit
professional society, with membership open to anyone.  It approves
members to the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), approves the formal
documentation of the Internet standards process, and pursues liaison
relationships in conjunction with the IAB.  The IAB also provides
oversight of the overall architecture and growth of the Internet and it
approves members to the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG).
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) develops the actual Internet
standards.  Activities are assigned to working groups which focus on
specific protocols.  Participation in working groups is open to
participation by anyone, with work carried out partly by electronic mail
and partly in face to face meetings.  Meetings are three times a year.
Documents of the IETF are freely and openly available.  Decisions by
working groups are achieved through a consensus process.  Internet
standards are published as part of the online Request for Comments (RFC)
series.


Why can't I ftp ISO standards?
------------------------------

ISO standard documents are copyrighted by ISO, and their price is much
higher than the costs for printing and shipping the papers. This is
because the expenses of running ISO are partially covered by selling
the standards (but ISO also gets member fees from the national
organizations).  Consequently, ISO standards are NOT available as
public domain documents to Internet users.

Many people feel that this is a great disadvantage and ISO is at the
moment examining other methods of distributing the documents (e.g.
CD-ROM, magnetic tapes and online access) but the odds are very low
that ISO standards will become freely redistributable files like
Internet RFCs in the near future (i.e. this decade).

BTW: The costs of actually developing standards is borne by the
thousands of organizations which pay for the time and travel expenses
of the delegates to national and international level meetings.

As a consequence of ISO's price and copyright policy for their
documents, ISO standards are VERY unavailable to students and
researchers with limited budget. Even huge companies have often only
single copies of ISO documents which have to be time-shared by many
engineers. This is very much contradicting to the very purpose of
formal non-proprietary standards which is being easily available to
everyone. That fact that ISO standards are not available online on the
Internet is not a technical problem: the ISO Central Secretariat in
Geneva is connected to the Internet and other public networks, they
have the necessary hosts, software and people available and they use
Internet services like ftp, gopher and WWW internally. But these
databases are not available to the public. This is a political problem,
not a technical one.

Other international standardization organizations either offer their
documents on the Internet freely (e.g. ITU and IETF) or send you the
paper versions free of charge (e.g. ECMA and many other vendor
organizations).

If you are involved in the development of an international
standard and are interested in the availability of your results
for students, etc., then it is highly recommended not to give this
standard directly to ISO, but to cooperate with other organizations
with more useful copyright policies (e.g. ECMA, ITU, IETF, ...).

By a liaison contribution from ISO/IEC JTC1/SC6 to the Internet
Architecture Board (IAB), a very few OSI standards (e.g. ISO 8073, ISO
8473, ISO 9542, ISO 10589) ARE available as PostScript files with ftp
from merit.edu in directory pub/iso as files clnp.ps, esis.ps, isis.ps
and idrp.ps.


Where can I get standard documents?
-----------------------------------

ISO standards are sold by the national standards body members (e.g.
ANSI, DIN, ...), by special companies, and by the ISO General
Secretary in Geneva. The standard way to order standards is to contact
your national standards body (check the list in the chapter 'What's
the address of my national standards body?'). If you want to get the
standards directly from ISO, you may order them from

     ISO Sales
     Case Postale 56
     CH-1211 Geneve 20
     Switzerland

     E-mail: sales@isocs.iso.ch

ISO accepts VISA and American Express. They require the card number,
its expiry date, and an authorizing signature. Some people prefer to
order their standards directly from ISO in Geneva, because some
national member bodies (e.g. ANSI) reprint ISO standards locally, use
cheaper paper and charge more for ISO standards than the headquarters.

ISO publishes an 'ISO Bulletin' with information about current
standardization activities and articles about various standards. It
lists all the ISO standards published or withdrawn, the DISs
circulated, the CDs registered, etc. It also has a calendar of all
upcoming ISO meetings. You can get it from your national standards body
or from the General Secretary in Geneva. You may get more information
on this from

     International Organization 
     for Standardization
     Promotion and Press Department
     Case Postale 56
     CH-1211 Geneve 20
     Switzerland

ISO publishes an annual 'ISO Catalogue' which lists all ISO standards
currently in force and other ISO publications (e.g. guides and
standards handbooks) with a price code. It contains an entry like

     ISO 4074-2:1980   Rubber condoms--
                       Part 2: Determination of length
                       Ed. 1   2 p.   Code A   TC 157

                       Preservatifs masculins en caoutchouc--
                       Partie 2: Determination de la longueur

for each ISO standard in both English and French and a few other lists.
You have to ask your national standards body how much you have to pay
them for a standard with price code A (e.g. 20 Swiss francs in
Switzerland and 27.10 DM in Germany). The price depends on the number
of pages of the document. Code A means 1 or 2 pages. :-(

You can order all ITU (was: CCITT) recommendations from

     International Telecommunication Union
     General Secretariat - Sales Section
     Place des Nations
     CH-1211 Geneve 20
     Switzerland

     phone  +41 22 7305111
     fax    +41 22 7305194
     e-mail helpdesk@itu.ch

There you can also get a free ITU List of Publications. The 1988 series
of recommendations has been published as the 'Blue Book' (consisting of
Volumes each dealing with a specific topic and bound as "Fascicles" of
a few hundred pages each) which fills about 16,000 pages or a whole
shelf. The Blue Book volumes are about the phone net, ISDN, telex and
teletex nets, fax protocols, OSI, international tariffs, etc. In the
past, CCITT recommendations have been published in a four year cycle.
These publications are identified by the color of their binding: 1960 red,
1964 blue, 1968 white, 1972 green, 1976 orange, 1980 yellow, 1984 red and
1988 blue. The 1992 White Book will be the last four year collection of
all recommendations. After this, recommendations will be published
separately.

A number of ISO's computer and telecommunication related standards
are are also published by ITU with another cover and another number,
so it's a good idea to check if you can't get the same standard MUCH
cheaper from ITU.

More information and some ASCII/PostScript/WinWord files with ITU
recommendations are available from the ITU server (see below).

The CCITT 1988 Blue Books are also available from:

     United Nations Bookshop
     General Assembly Building
     Room:  G.A. 32 B
     New York, NY 10017
     USA

     phone +1 212 963-7680
           (800) 553-3210 (USA only, except NY)
     fax   +1 212 963-4910

     Visa or Mastercard are accepted over $15.00.
     $2 per book for shipping/handling.
     UPS over 5 books is free of charge.
     E.g. the fascicle with X.400-X.420 costs $68.70.

All ECMA standards are free and can be ordered at no cost from

     European Computer
     Manufacturers Association
     114 Rue du Rhone
     CH-1204 Geneva
     Switzerland

     phone  +41 22 7353634
     fax    +41 22 7865231

     e-mail helpdesk@ecma.ch
     X.400  C=ch, A=arcom, P=ecma, O=genevanet, OU1=ecma, S=helpdesk

A number of ISO's computer related standards are only ECMA standards
with another cover and another number, so it's a good idea to check
if you can't get the same standard free from ECMA without giving an
arm or a leg to ISO.

The address of the European Telecommunication Standards Institute is:

     ETSI
     F-06921 Sophia Antipolis CEDEX
     France

     teletex 302107 bvb awg

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) also
publishes standards. They can be ordered by email from the IEEE
Computer Society Press:

     Send an email message to <cs.books@compmail.com> and include your
     name, IEEE membership number, shipping address, phone number,
     publication title, catalog number and price.
     Payment accepted by credit card or purchase order. Credit card
     orders must include: card number, expiration date and your name
     as it appears on the card. Purchase orders must include: purchase
     order number, name of purchasing organization, your name, phone
     number and shipping address.

For several years the US company OMNICOM published a newsletter about
OSI development and distributed copies of ISO standards. Document
distribution for OMNICOM (which is out of business) has been taken over
by Phillips Business Information.  The phone number (800) OMNICOM still
works, but is answered by Phillips.

     fax   +1 415 591 7617

It is highly recommended to compare prices before ordering standards!


How can I get in contact with the committees?
---------------------------------------------

The standard way is to contact the members of your national standards
body. Some of these people will also serve as your country's
representatives to the international organizations.

Only a very few experts active within ISO and CCITT are regularly reading
USENET but most are reachable with Internet mail.

The editor of the new ASN.1 encoding rules standard (ISO 8825) is

     Bancroft Scott <baos@oss.oss.com>

The editor of the X.gc group working on a news extension for the
X.400 electronic mail protocols similar to USENET is

     Jacob Palme, Stockholm University <jpalme@dsv.su.se>

ECMA has email access and the secretary-general can be reached with

     <jan.van-den-beld@ecma.ch>.

ISO Central Secretariat also has email access. The usual address is 

     Internet: <surname>@isocs.iso.ch
     X.400:    C=CH; ADMD=ARCOM; PRMD=ISO; O=ISOCS; S=<surname>

E.g., some known addresses are

     Michael Smith     <smith@isocs.iso.ch>
     Jacques Chabot    <chabot@isocs.iso.ch>
     Keith Brannon     <brannon@isocs.iso.ch>       (responsible for IT)
     Vasilii Zakharov  <zakharov@isocs.iso.ch>      (IT director)

ISO's hot line phone number is +41 22 749-0222.

IEC also is up on email and is accessable from Internet through
a bridge (that's sometimes down). One address is e.g.:

     Jack Sheldon <jack.sheldon@iecmhs.iec.inet.ch>


How can I get electronic versions of CCITT/ITU-T recommendations
----------------------------------------------------------------

ITU now operates a public ITU Document Store (ITUDOC). It can be reached
as a mail server and interactively with a Gopher interface.  An FTP
Server is planned.

For more detailed assistance than given below, please contact:

International Telecommunication Union
Information Services Department
Place des Nations
1211 Geneva 20
Switzerland

TEL: +41 22 730 5554
FAX: +41 22 730 5337
RFC822: helpdesk@itu.ch
X.400: S=helpdesk;A=arcom;P=itu;C=ch


INTERACTIVE ACCESS TO ITUDOC

Interactive access to ITUDOC is available as one of ITU's 'Open 
Services' available in TIES (Telecom Information Exchange Services). 
Connectivity to TIES is possible via:

1. GOPHER CLIENT

   Pointer to the ITU Gopher Server is

   Name=International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
   Host=info.itu.ch
   Port=70

2. TELNET

   Telnet: ties.itu.ch or info.itu.ch (login name 'gopher')

3. X.25

   Call the X.25 DTE address, on TELEPAC, the Swiss PSPDN

   #228468111112

   where # is local prefix for international routing, login name 
   'gopher'

4. DIAL-UP

   +41 22 733 7575 (Swiss telephone number, login name 'gopher')

   Supported modem protocols include ITU-T (CCITT) V.21, V.22, 
   V.22bis, V.32, V.42, V.42bis Recommendations, Bell212A and MNP 2, 
   3, 4, 5. Basic settings should be no parity, 8 data bits 
   (necessary for on-line reading of multilingual material), speed 
   300 to 9,600 bps.

For downloading documents/files, several file transfer methods are 
supported (e.g., Kermit, XModem, Text, FTP, email).


EMAIL ACCESS TO ITUDOC

For help on the ITUDOC electronic mail interface, send a message with 
the line HELP in it to:

itudoc@itu.ch

The mail server will return to you a help document explaining all 
valid commands.  For example, to retrieve any ITUDOC document, you 
send the command:

GET <UPI>

where <UPI> is the UPI (Unique Permanent Identifier) for the 
document.  For example, to retrieve the index of the ITU-T (ITU 
Telecommunication Standardization Sector) Group, send the command:

GET ITU-1100

See below for the UPIs of other index files.  You can place multiple 
commands in a single message (maximum 50).


ITUDOC INDEX FILES

Here are UPIs for key ITUDOC index files.  Index files describe the 
structure of groups and list UPIs for all documents available in the 
group.  Index files are updated every two weeks.

Title: Road Map and Index for ITUDOC (About ITUDOC) Group
UPI: ITU-1800

Title: Road Map and Index for GS (ITU General Secretariat) Group
UPI: ITU-1700

Title: Road Map and Index for ITU-D (ITU Development Sector) Group

Which Internet resources provide information about standards?
-------------------------------------------------------------

The author of this FAQ maintains an archive where information about
ISO standards is collected at anonymous ftp server ftp.uni-erlangen.de
in pub/doc/ISO/. Contact <mskuhn@cip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de>
if you would like to contribute anything. (A few German texts are
available in pub/doc/ISO/deutsch.)

The RFCs are ftpable from nic.ddn.mil, ftp.nisc.sri.com, nnsc.nsf.net and
from many other sites all over the world.

For information about POSIX, the ISO and IEEE standard for UNIX
compatible operating systems, look at the file ~ftp/usenet/comp.std.unix
on ftp.uu.net.

Other ftp locations with information about OSI and other ISO standards
are:

What's the meaning of CD, DIS, IS?
----------------------------------

[Posted by Brad Smith <smithb@durer.cme.nist.gov>:]

Replies to an earlier posting of mine indicated a lack of familiarity
with current ISO procedures for developing and gaining consensus on
international standards.  Here are some notes to update you.

The 1989 revision of the ISO/IEC Directives specify the accepted
procedure for developing and approving International Standards.  This
is a complicated process with many activities and critical milestones
so if you do any standards work, you will probably want to get a copy
of the document for reference.

THE ISO PROCESS:

The Directives give a set of procedures for managing the work of a
committee which define five stages of document approval:

       The Proposal Stage
            Voting members ballot on the creation of a new
            standards project.

       The Preparatory Stage
            Project Leader manages the development of a Working
            Draft.

       The Committee Stage
            Consensus is achieved on a Committee Draft.

       The Approval Stage
            National bodies vote on a Draft International
            Standard.

       The Publication Stage
            ISO publishes the International Standard.

PROPOSAL STAGE:

The Proposal stage begins with a suggestion for a new area of
standardization activity (see [ISO1] - clause 2.2, page 17).  The
suggestion is documented on an ISO New Work Item Proposal form and is
sent out by the committee's Secretariat to all participating and
observing members of the committee, to all liaison organizations, and
to other national bodies of ISO.  A three-month voting period is
prescribed.  All voting members have an obligation to reply.  

Approval requires a simple majority vote and a commitment by at least
five national bodies to actively participate.  Projects can be placed
within an existing Working Group (WG), or a new WG can be created to
act as a focus for technical development work.  

The Proposal stage ends when a New Work Item is approved, is registered
with the ISO, and is included in the list of projects within the
program of work of the SC-4 Committee.

PREPARATORY STAGE:

The Preparatory stage of ISO standards development covers the creation
of a working draft of the ultimate standard (see [ISO1] - clause 2.3,
page 17).  The work is performed by experts from participating
countries organized into working groups and advisory groups under the
guidance of a convener, and further subdivided into project areas each
under the direction of a Project Leader (see [ISO1] - clause 2.1.6,
page 16).  

Different committees may decide on different procedures to govern the
development of working drafts of their standards.  In our committee,
Working Group conveners have been encouraged to subdivide the technical
work into logical tasks each under the direction of a Project Leader. 
Project Leaders report to the Convener of their parent Working Group. 
The Working Group convener usually serves as a Project Leader (see
[ISO1] - clause 2.3.3, page 17) but is additionally responsible for
coordinating any other Project Leaders in the WG as well. 

As technical work is completed by a WG, it is documented in a working
draft of an ISO standard and begins the process of consensus-building
and approval.  Generally, each document has an editor who has custody
of the electronic form of the document, but the project leader has the
overall responsibility for coordinating the efforts necessary to gain
approval of the draft as an international standard.

The ISO Directives do not give details of the process for developing a
working draft within the hierarchy of projects, WGs, and advisory
groups.  That is left for each SC to establish for itself.  Our
committee has a detailed set of procedures which are available if
anyone wants to see them.

The Preparatory stage for any one Part ends when a working draft of
that Part has been approved by the Project Management Advisory Group. 
It is at that time given to the Secretariat of SC-4 who formally
registers the Part as a Committee Draft with ISO (see [ISO1] - clause
2.3.8, page 18).

COMMITTEE STAGE:

The Committee stage begins with the circulation of the document in the
form of a Committee Draft (CD) for formal balloting (see [ISO1], clause
2.4.1, page 18 and SC4 Res# 73).  The ballot is sent out by the
committee Secretariat to all participating and observing countries of
SC-4 and also to Class A Liaison organizations.  All recipients are
asked for comments on the CD.  Voting members are asked to vote on the
acceptance of the CD for registration as a Draft International
Standard.  All voting members have an obligation to reply.  A three
month voting period is prescribed.  Ballot comments are collected and
summarized by the Secretariat.  

A team consisting of the Secretariat, the committee Chairman, the
affected Conveners, and the affected Project Leaders review the ballot
comments to determine the degree of consensus obtained.  Based on the
evaluation, a decision is made whether to

       a)  discuss the CD and comments at the next meeting,
       b)  register the CD as a Draft International Standard, or
       c)  ask that a revised CD be prepared for circulation

If at least three voting members of SC-4 disagree with proposal b) or
c) of the Secretariat, the CD will be put on the agenda for discussion
at the next committee meeting.

Failure to attain consensus approval of a Part will trigger
determination c) above and thus cause the document to be returned to
the Working Group level for the preparation of a revised Committee
Draft.

It should be noted that both an English and a French text must be
available for each Part during the Approval stage which comes next. 
This translation should be instigated at an early date to allow time
for a quality effort.

The Committee stage ends for a CD when the Part is accepted by
committee ballot.  The document is then given to the Secretariat who
formally submits the English and French versions to ISO for
registration of the Part as a Draft International Standard (see [ISO1]
- clause 2.4.7, page 19).

APPROVAL STAGE:

The Approval Stage begins with circulation of the English and French
versions of the Part in the form of a Draft International Standard
(DIS) for formal balloting (see [ISO1] - clause 2.5.1, page 19).  The
ballot is sent out by ISO Central Secretariat to all national bodies of
ISO (our committee members plus others).  Recipients are asked to vote
on the approval of the DIS as an International Standard.  All national
bodies have an obligation to reply.  A six-month voting period is
prescribed.  Ballot comments are collected by ISO and are returned to
our committee.

The DIS is approved if a two-thirds majority of votes cast by voting
members of our committee are in favor and if not more than 25% of the
total number of votes cast are negative.  Abstentions are excluded when
counting votes (see [ISO1] - clause 2.5.3, page 20).  If so approved,
the committee Chairman, in cooperation with the Secretariat, and in
consultation with the ISO Chief Executive Officer makes a decision
whether the document should be published without change or whether an
amendment should be drafted to reflect persuasive technical comments
received (see [ISO1] - clause 2.5.4, page 20).  If an amendment is
drafted, it requires a two-month vote as above.

If the DIS is not approved, the Committee Chairman, in cooperation with
the Secretariat (and, if necessary the Project Leader and the affected
WG Conveners), and in consultation with the ISO Chief Executive
Officer, makes a decision whether to prepare a new DIS for a two-month
vote or to refer the document back to committee for further work (see
[ISO1] - clause 2.5.6, page 20).

The Approval stage ends with the decision of the committee Chairman to
publish.  The Secretariat then prepares the final manuscript and sends
it to ISO.

PUBLICATION STAGE:

The ISO Chief Executive Officer does final preparation of the Foreword
and sends the proof back to the SC-4 Secretariat for review.  Further
editorial or technical amendments are unacceptable at this stage.

The Publication stage ends with the release of the document as an
International Standard.

[FAQ author's note: The reference [ISO1] hasn't been resolved in Brad
Smith's original posting, but, according to the ISO Catalogue, the
complete ISO ceremony of creating a standard is defined in:

  IEC/ISO Directives -- Part 1,
  Procedures for the technical work,
  1989, 140p., ISBN 92-67-10150-1.

  IEC/ISO Directives -- Part 2,
  Methodology for the development of International Standards,
  1989, 62p., ISBN 92-67-10149-8.

  IEC/ISO Directives -- Part 3,
  Drafting and presentation of International Standards,
  1989, 2nd ed., 82 p., bilingual, ISBN 92-67-01055-7. 

Harald Alvestrand wrote me, that there is also something called a "CD
ballot" that is needed to get a document from "expert contribution"
status to "CD" status, and that there are exceptions to the "French
required" rules. He has one DIS that says on the cover: "In accordance
with the provisions of Council Resolution 21/1986 this DIS is submitted
in the English language only"]

Eberhard Wegner noted, that "JTC 1 have their own Directives, replacing
ISO/IEC Directives. It is even worse: ISO and IEC have separately adopted the
Vienna Agreement with CEN (on common simultaneous voting), but JTC 1 has
not; so it is not valid for them. Instead of overcoming the separation
between ISO and IEC, the creation of JTC 1 introduced a third body."

Another nice explanation :-) has been posted by Chad Fogg <cfogg@ole.cdac.com>:

  Here is the evolutionary chart of ISO standards:

  1. Barroom witticism ("NI" or "Napkin Item")
  2. New proposal ("NP" or "Need Permission")
  3. Working Draft ("WD" or "We were Drunk")
  4. Committee Draft ("CD" or "Calendar Deadlock")
  5. Draft International Standard ("DIS" or "Doesn't Include Substance")
  6. International Standard ("IS" or "Induced patent Statements")


ISO standards relevant to computing
-----------------------------------

A summary of ISO and CCITT standards relevant to OSI (Open System
Interconnection) protocols is part of the osi-protocols FAQ which is
posted to comp.protocols.iso.

Some of these standards are also available from ECMA or ITU. The ECMA or
ITU text is not always 100% identical, but usually "technically aligned".
If you want to be sure what the most official version is, order ISO,
if you can't afford ISO, try the free or at least cheaper ECMA or
ITU version.

IEC 824    Terminology related to microprocessors

ISO 2022   ESC sequences for switching between various character sets
           [ECMA-35]

ISO 2382   Information technology -- Vocabulary

ISO 3166   Codes for the representation of names of countries.
           This standard defines a 2-letter, a 3-letter and a numeric
           code for each country on this planet. E.g. US/USA/840=
           United States, DE/DEU/276=Germany, GB/GBR/826=United
           Kingdom, FR/FRA/250=France, ...)
           The 2-letter codes are well known in the Internet as top-level
           domain names. The 3-letter versions are often used at
           international sports events.

ISO 4217   Codes for the representation of currencies and funds

ISO 5218   Representation of human sexes
           Sex is represented by a one-character language independent
           numerical code: 0=not known, 1=male, 2=female, 9=not 
           specified. The standard also specifies, that "no significance
           is to be placed on the fact that 'Male' is coded '1' and 
           'Female' is coded '2'.  This standard was developed based 
           upon predominant practice of the countries involved and does 
           not convey any meaning of importance, ranking or any other 
           basis that could imply discrimination." :-)

ISO 6429   ASCII Control Codes. Subsets of these are also known as
           VT100/VT320/ANSI escape sequences.

ISO 7816   Chip cards. Specifies the dimensions, connector locations,
           electrical specifications, the lower layer protocol format
           (bidirectional 9600 bits/s async. serial) and the format
           of some common data packets of smart cards.

ISO 8601   Representation of dates and times.
           This standard defines a lot of details of the calendar.
           E.g. the ISO definition of the week numbers is that the 
           first day (day number 1) of a week is Monday and that the 
           first week in a year (week number 1) is the week that includes
           the first Thursday in January, i.e. the first week that has at
           least four days in January. Other definitions are, e.g., that 
           hours of a day are counted from 0 to 24 and that the
           international notation of dates is the Bigendian format 
           year-month-day, e.g. 1993-04-17 and that for time is e.g.
           20:36:04 (hh:mm:ss). There are also string formats for
           computer applications specified that have to represent
           date and time in files and protocol packets. (See
           ftp.uni-erlangen.de:pub/doc/ISO/ISO8601.ps.Z for a
           very detailed summary.)

ISO 8632   Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM). This standard defines
           a file format for 2D vector graphics. Part 1 defines the
           graphic elements (lines, filled polygons, text, colors, ...)
           that may appear in a CGM and the other parts define 3 different
           encodings for these graphic elements:

              Character encoding:  compact ASCII encoding, useful if
                                   CGM files have to be transported
                                   over not binary-transparent channels
                                   (e.g. e-mail, character set converter)
              Binary encoding:     this is the most often implemented
                                   CGM encoding, because it is both
                                   efficient and easy to implement.
              Clear text encoding: a human readable textual encoding.

           This standard format might be exactly what you need if you
           want to store pictures that can be drawn by the usual graphic
           library functions (move, line, set_color, set_linestyle, ...)
           in an resolution-independend way. The format is simple and
           easy to understand. The new 1992 revision of the CGM standard
           contains many additional graphic elements (splines, rendering
           options for ends and joins of thick lines, several color
           models, high quality fonts, grouping of graphical elements, ...)
           that make this format capable of storing images with the quality
           you are used to get from Postscript, Corel Draw, Framemaker,
           etc. The main difference between CGM and Postscript is that
           Postscript is a full programming language while CGM is just
           a simple list of graphical elements which makes CGM suitable
           for reediting.

           known as 'Unicode' that is expected to become pretty

ISO standards of general relevance
----------------------------------

(Of course, there are a more then 10 000 of them, so this list will
always contain only a few of the more well-known international 
standards.)

ISO 3      Preferred numbers
           Especially in engineering applications, where a designer often
           has to choose an arbitrary dimension (e.g. the length of a
           part) within a range, it might be useful to have some
           'preferred numbers' defined that should be preferred in these
           situations. These are 1, 1.6, 2.5, 4, 6.3 which might be 
           multiplied or divided by 10 as often as necessary and should be
           used together with SI (metric) units. The above simplest
           set of preferred numbers devides the range from 1 to 10 with 5
           numbers. There are also supersets with more numbers defined, e.g.
           1, 1.25, 1.6, 2, 2.5, 3.15, 4, 5, 6.3, 8. This standard is perhaps
           less relevant in computer science, where programmers traditionally
           use the powers of two (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...) multiplied by 1, 3 or
           5 as 'preferred numbers'. [Warning: using only powers of 2
           in software, e.g. as array sizes, can also have disadvantages
           such as reduced cache efficiency.]

ISO paper sizes
---------------

The paper formats defined by ISO in the A, B and C series are used
today in nearly all countries apart from North America.

The formats have been determined according to the following rules:

  - A0 has an area of one square meter.
  - The aspect ratio of all members of the A, B and C-series is
    sqrt(2) = 1.41421...
  - You get the next higher format by cutting the paper in two
    equal pieces parallel to the shorter side. This results again in
    a 1 : sqrt(2) format (that's the big advantage of this format).
  - The size of a B-series paper is the geometric mean between the size of
    the corresponding A-series paper and the next bigger A-series paper.
    E.g. B1 is between A1 and A0.
  - The size of a C-series paper is the geometric mean between the size of
    the A-series and B-series paper with the same number.

This means that the following formulas give the dimensions in meters:

                      Width                   Height
      A-series        2 ^ (- 1/4 - n/2)       2 ^ (1/4 - n/2)
      B-series        2 ^ (      - n/2)       2 ^ (1/2 - n/2)
      C-series        2 ^ (- 1/8 - n/2)       2 ^ (3/8 - n/2)

Larger sizes have smaller numbers.  Sizes larger than those with n = 0
are written as 2 A0 and 4 A0 rather than A(-1) and A(-2).

The following table lists the official definitions of the paper sizes
which are the values from the above formulas rounded more-or-less to
an integral number of millimeters:

      4 A0 1682 x 2378
      2 A0 1189 x 1682
        A0  841 x 1189       B0 1000 x 1414       C0  917 x 1297
        A1  594 x 841        B1  707 x 1000       C1  648 x 917
        A2  420 x 594        B2  500 x 707        C2  458 x 648
        A3  297 x 420        B3  353 x 500        C3  324 x 458
        A4  210 x 297        B4  250 x 353        C4  229 x 324
        A5  148 x 210        B5  176 x 250        C5  162 x 229
        A6  105 x 148        B6  125 x 176        C6  114 x 162
        A7   74 x 105        B7   88 x 125        C7   81 x 114
        A8   52 x 74         B8   62 x 88         C8   57 x 81
        A9   37 x 52         B9   44 x 62         C9   40 x 57
        A10  26 x 37         B10  31 x 44         C10  28 x 40

The most popular sizes are perhaps:

        A0        technical drawings
        A4        letters, magazines, documents
        A5        books
        C4,C5,C6  envelopes
        B4,A3     supported by many copy machines, newspapers

There are also strip formats possible, e.g.

    1/3 A4   99 x 210
    2/3 A4  198 x 210
    1/4 A4   74 x 210
    1/8 A4   37 x 210
    1/4 A3  105 x 297
    1/3 A5   70 x 148
    etc.

All these formats are paper end formats, i.e. these are the dimensions
of the paper delivered to the user/reader. Other standards define slightly
bigger paper sizes for applications where the paper will be cut to the
end format later (e.g. after binding).

The ISO DL envelope format has the dimensions 220 x 110 millimeters.

(The values have been copied from DIN 476 (Dec 1976) which is the 
German version of the ISO 216 standard).


What is ISO 9000?
-----------------

Q. I've seen recently announcements of several big companies in
newspapers, where they tell their customers that they now conform to
ISO 9000. What is ISO 9000? 

A. A standard for the development process of a product.

Q. Why has ISO 9000 been written and what does it mean if a company
claims to conform to ISO 9000 ?

A. I think, it means that the product which carries the ISO 9000
certified mark has undergone a well-defined, well-engineered,
well-monitored design/development/testing/production process. (This in
turn is expected to imply that the product is not a result of some
hap-hazard development and thus is of a superior quality.)

The agency which registers a product as ISO registered expects that the
business produce a "Quality Manual". They verify the manual against the
ISO 9000 standards. Then they verify that the design/development/test
etc. processes closely agree with what is mentioned in the Quality
Manual, recommend corrective actions, if any, and after a few periodic
(at least 6 monthly) assesments certify the product as an ISO 9000
registered product.

Q. A few practical examples? 

Basically, it results in "Document everything you do" and "Do what you
have documented". It is expected that there will be a documented
procedure for everything that is done in the design/development/testing
of a product. The ISO inspectors are quite meticulous about these
things. (I heard some of the ISO coordinators relating there
experiences.)

Key changes needed:

   o Training of the full time personnel to understand ISO 9000
     standards, ISO Audit, etc.
   o Alerting all the employees of upcoming ISO audits and having
     periodic educational talks on how to work in a ISO framework.
   o Slowly changing the work habits of the employees so that: They 
     do what is documented and the document says exactly what they 
     are doing.

Key considerations:

   o Financial commitment involved in getting ISO registed. (Close to
     $20k per product over a 2 year period in external costs + internal
     costs in training people work hours lost during the audits (3-5 days 
     a years) + cost of the QC department). [Figures based on UL's 
     ISO 9000 registration figures.]

   o Will the employees be happily willing to work in this tight
     "document everything you do" framework?

Advantages:

   o "ISO approved" seems to be a green signal for the European
     customers to buy a product.

If ISO 9000 is forseen as a "way to go" for the future in US/World then
it would be a good idea to start early.

[I wish to thank Sandeep Phadke <sandeep@acsc.com>, who attended a
seminar on ISO 9000 recently, for this USENET interview.]

You'll find a more detailed and precise explanation of ISO 9000 with
anonymous ftp in ftp.uni-erlangen.de:pub/doc/ISO/ISO-9000-summary.

What's the address of my national standards body?
-------------------------------------------------

The address of the ISO headquarters is:

International Organization
for Standardization
Case postale 56
1, rue de Varembé
CH-1211 Genève 20
Switzerland

            national        (022) 749 01 11    (In correct and complete
Telephone   -------------------------------     CCITT E.123 notation :-)

Telefax     +41 22 733 34 30
Telex       41 22 05 iso ch
Telegrams   isorganiz

And here comes a list of the current 91 member bodies of ISO. According
to ISO regulations, only one organization "most representative of
standardization in its country" is allowed to be ISO member body in
each country. Revisions to the following addresses are announced in the
monthly ISO Bulletin. The author of this FAQ has currently no access to
the ISO Bulletin, so it is up to the better informed reader whether this
list will stay up to date. The addresses in this list are from the
official ISO member list from september 1992 and have been typed in as
an 8-bit ISO 8859-1 Latin 1 file by Inge A. Suhr.

Each Organization with a '*' is a sales agent for ISO publications in
its country. The names of the countries are given in both English and
French (seems to be an old ISO tradition ;-).

"A correspondent member is normally an organization in a developing
country which does not yet have its own national standards body.
Correspondent members do not take an active part in the technical
work, but are entitled to be kept fully informed about the work of
interest to them. Nearly all the present correspondent members are
governmental institutions." [from: ISO member list]
