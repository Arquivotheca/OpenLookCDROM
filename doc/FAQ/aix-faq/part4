Frequently Asked Questions about AIX and the IBM RS/6000 Section 4
__________________________________________________________________

2.07: What's with malloc()?
 
malloc() uses a late allocation algorithm based on 4.3 BSD's malloc()
for speed.  This lets you allocate very large sparse memory spaces,
since the pages are not actually allocated until they are touched for
the first time.  Unfortunately, it doesn't die gracefully in the face of
loss of available memory.  See the "Paging Space Overview" under
InfoExplorer, and see the notes on the linker in this document for an
example of an ungraceful death.

If you want your program to get notified when running out of memory, you
should handle the SIGDANGER signal.  The default is to ignore it. 
SIGDANGER is sent to all processes when paging space gets low, and if
paging space gets even lower, processes with the highest paging space
usage are sent the SIGKILL signal.

malloc() is substantially different in 3.2, allocating memory more
tightly.  If you have problems running re-compiled programs on 3.2,
try running them with MALLOCTYPE=3.1.

Early Page Space Allocation (EPSA) added to AIX 3.2: see
/usr/lpp/bos/README.PSALLOC - IX38211 / U422496 Allows setting of
early allocation (vs. default late allocation) on a per-process basis.


2.07+ Why does it take so long to compile "hello world" with xlc?

Some systems have experianced delays of more than 60 seconds in
compiling "#include <stdio.h> int main () {printf ("Hello world");}"
The problem is with the license manager contact IBM to make sure
you've got the latest PTF.


2.08: Why does xlc complain about 'extern char *strcpy()'

The header <string.h> has a strcpy macro that expands strcpy(x,y) to
__strcpy(x,y), and the latter is then used by the compiler to generate
inline code for strcpy.  Because of the macro, your extern declaration
contains an invalid macro expansion.  The real cure is to remove your
extern declaration but adding -U__STR__ to your xlc will also do the trick.


2.09: Why do I get 'Parameter list cannot contain fewer ....'

This is the same as above.


2.10: Why does xlc complain about '(sometype *)somepointer = something'

Software that is developed using gcc may have this construct. However,
standard C does not permit casts to be lvalues, so you will need to
change the cast and move it to the right side of the assignment. If you
compile with 'cc', removing the cast completely will give you a warning,
'xlc' will give you an error (provided somepointer and something are of
different types - but else, why would the cast be there in the first place?)


2.11: Some more common errors

Here are a few other common errors with xlc:

305 |     switch((((np)->navigation_type) ? (*((np)->navigation_type)) :
      ((void *)0)))
      .a...........  
a - 1506-226: (S) The second and third operands of the conditional
operator must be of the same type.

The reason for this is that xlc defines NULL as (void *)0, and it does
not allow two different types as the second and third operand of ?:. 
The second argument above is not a pointer and the code used NULL
incorrectly as a scalar. NULL is a nil pointer constant in ANSI C and
in some traditional compilers.

You should change NULL in the third argument above to an integer 0.


2.12: Can the compiler generate assembler code?

Starting with version 1.3 of xlc and xlf the -S option will generate a
.s assembly code file prior to optimization. The option -qlist will
generate a human readable one in a .lst file.

There is also a disassembler in /usr/lpp/xlc/bin/dis include with the
1.3 version of xlc (and in /usr/lpp/xlC/bin/dis with the 2.1 version
of xlC) that will disassemble existing object or executable files.


2.13: Curses

Curses based applications should be linked with -lcurses and _not_ with
-ltermlib. It has also been reported that some problems with curses are
avoided if your application is compiled with -DNLS.

Peter Jeffe <peter@ski.austin.ibm.com> also notes:

>the escape sequences for cursor and function keys are *sometimes*
>treated as several characters: eg. the getch() - call does not return
>KEY_UP but 'ESC [ C.'

You're correct in your analysis: this has to do with the timing of the
escape sequence as it arrives from the net. There is an environment
variable called ESCDELAY that can change the fudge factor used to decide
when an escape is just an escape. The default value is 500; boosting
this a bit should solve your problems.

Christopher Carlyle O'Callaghan <asdfjkl@wam.umd.edu> has more comments
concerning extended curses:

1) The sample program in User Interface Programming Concepts, page 7-13
   is WRONG. Here is the correct use of panes and panels.

#include <cur01.h>
#include <cur05.h>

main()
{
PANE *A, *B, *C, *D, *E, *F, *G, *H;
PANEL *P;

initscr();

A = ecbpns (24, 79, NULL, NULL, 0, 2500, Pdivszp, Pbordry, NULL, NULL);
D = ecbpns (24, 79, NULL, NULL, 0, 0,    Pdivszf, Pbordry, NULL, NULL);
E = ecbpns (24, 79, D,    NULL, 0, 0,    Pdivszf, Pbordry, NULL, NULL);
B = ecbpns (24, 79, A, D, Pdivtyh, 3000, Pdivszp, Pbordry, NULL, NULL);
F = ecbpns (24, 79, NULL, NULL, 0, 0,    Pdivszf, Pbordry, NULL, NULL);
G = ecbpns (24, 79, F,    NULL, 0, 5000, Pdivszp, Pbordry, NULL, NULL);
H = ecbpns (24, 79, G,    NULL, 0, 3000, Pdivszp, Pbordry, NULL, NULL);
C = ecbpns (24, 79, B, F, Pdivtyh, 0, Pdivszf, Pbordry, NULL, NULL);
P = ecbpls (24, 79, 0, 0, "MAIN PANEL", Pdivtyv, Pbordry, A);

ecdvpl (P);
ecdfpl (P, FALSE);
ecshpl (P); 
ecrfpl (P);
endwin();
}

2) DO NOT include <curses.h> and any other <cur0x.h> file together.
   You will get a bunch of redefined statements.

3) There is CURSES and EXTENDED CURSES. Use only one or the other. If the
   manual says that they're backwards compatible or some other indication 
   that you can use CURSES routines with EXTENDED, don't believe it. To 
   use CURSES you need to include <curses.h> and you can't (see above).

4) If you use -lcur and -lcurses in the same link command, you will get
   Memory fault (core dump) error. You CANNOT use both of them at the same
   time. -lcur is for extended curses, -lcurses is for regular curses.

5) When creating PANEs, when you supply a value (other than 0) for the
   'ds' parameter and use Pdivszf value for the 'du' parameter, the 'ds'
   will be ignored (the sample program on page 7-13 in User Interface
   Programming Concepts is wrong.) For reasons as yet undetermined,
   Pdivszc doesn't seem to work (or at least I can't figure out how to
   use it.)

6) If you're running into bugs and can't figure out what is happening,
   try the following:
   include -qextchk -g in your compile line
	-qextchk will check to make sure you're passing the right number of
  	 parameters to the functions
	-g enables debug

7) Do not use 80 as the number of columns if you want to use the whole
   screen. The lower right corner will get erased.  Use 79 instead.

8) If you create a panel, you must create at least 1 pane, otherwise you
   will get a Memory fault (core dump).

9) When creating a panel, if you don't have a border around it, any title
   you want will not show up.

10) to make the screen scroll down:
    wmove (win, 0, 0);
    winsertln (win)

11) delwin(win) doesn't work in EXTENDED WINDOWS

    To make it appear as if a window is deleted, you need to do the following:
    for every window that you want to appear on the screen
	touchwin(win)
	wrefresh(win)

    you must make sure that you do it in the exact same order as you put
    them on the screen (i.e., if you called newwin with A, then C, then B,
    then you must do the loop with A, then C, then B, otherwise you won't
    get the same screen back).  The best thing to do is to put them into
    an array and keep track of the last window index.

12) mvwin(win, line, col) implies that it is only used for viewports and
    subwindows. It can also be used for the actual windows themselves.

13) If you specify the attribute of a window using wcolorout(win), any
    subsequent calls to chgat(numchars, mode) or any of its relatives
    will not work. (or at least they get very picky.)


2.14: How do I speed up linking

Please refer to sections 2.03 and 2.06 above.

From: losecco@undpdk.hep.nd.edu (John LoSecco) and
      hook@chaco.aix.dfw.ibm.com (Gary R. Hook)

>From oahu.cern.ch in /pub/aix3 you can get a wrapper for the existing
linker called tld which can reduce link times with large libraries by
factors of 3 to 4.


2.15: What is deadbeef?

When running the debugger (dbx), you may have wondered what the
'deadbeef' is you occasionally see in registers.  Do note, that
0xdeadbeef is a hexadecimal number that also happens to be some kind
of word (the RS/6000 was built in Texas!), and this hexadecimal number
is simply put into unused registers at some time, probably during
program startup.


2.17: How do I make an export list from a library archive?
From: d.dennerline@bull.com (Dave Dennerline)

This script will only extract the "export"able names and should be
useful in starting the shared library creation process. The user must
determine which names should be included in the import and export lists.
It's only been tested on a few library archives.

#!/bin/ksh
#
# mkexps - make export list
# This program creates an export list by combining all the "." and normal names
# into one list. 
#
if [[ "$#" -ne 1 ]]
then
    print "Usage: mkexps ArchiveFile"
    exit -2
fi
if [[ ! -f $1 ]] 
then
    print "mkexps: Cannot open file \"$1\""
    exit -1
fi
dump -g $1 | awk '
BEGIN {
        top = 1
}    
/^[ ]*[0-9][0-9]*/ {
    if ( (n = index( $2, "." )) > 0 ) {
        export_array[ top++ ] = substr( $2, n+1, length( $2 ))
    }
    else {
	export_array[ top++ ] = $2
    }
}

END {
    for ( i = 1; i < top; i++ )
    {
	print export_array[ i ]
    }

}' | sort | uniq


2.18 Building imake, makedepend
From: crow@austin.ibm.com (David L. Crow)

    You need X11dev.src release 1.2.3.0 (ie the R5 release).  
     Unless you have an R5 release of AIXwindows, there is no xmkmf.
  These are the steps that I use to make imake, makedepend and all
  of it's config files, and then install them in the working tree
  (ie not the Xamples) for daily use:
  
      cd /usr/lpp/X11/Xamples
      make Makefile
      make SUBDIRS="config util" Makefiles
      make SUBDIRS="config util" linklibs
      make SUBDIRS="config util" depend
      make SUBDIRS="config util" 
      make SUBDIRS="config util" install
      
  Then redo the steps everytime you apply an X11 update.


2.19: How can tell what shared libraries a binary is linked with?

Use "dump -H <execfilename>" and see if anything other than /unix is
listed in the loader section (at the bottom).  The first example is
/bin/sh (statically linked) and the second example is
/usr/local/bin/bash (shared).

INDEX  PATH                          BASE                MEMBER              
0      /usr/lib:/lib                                                         
1      /                             unix                                    

INDEX  PATH                          BASE                MEMBER              
0      ./lib/readline/:./lib/glob/:/usr/lib:/lib               
1                                    libc.a              shr.o               
2                                    libcurses.a         shr.o               


2.20: Can I get a PTF for my C/C++ compiler from the net?

Unfortunately, the compiler group does not release PTFs.  You have to
call IBM and ask for the latest tape.


2.21: Why does "install"ing software I got from the net fail?

Note that the RS/6000 has two install programs, one with System V flavor
in the default PATH (/etc/install with links from /usr/bin and /usr/usg),
and one with BSD behavior in /usr/ucb/install.

----------------------------------------------------
3.00: Fortran and other compilers

This section covers all compilers other than C/C++.  On Fortran, there
seem to have been some problems with floating point handling, in
particular floating exceptions.


3.01: I have problems mixing Fortran and C code, why?

A few routines (such as getenv, signal, and system) exist in both the
Fortran and C libraries but with different parameters. In the recent
past, if you have a mixed program that calls getenv from both C and
Fortran code, you have to link them carefully by specifying the correct
library first on your command line. This is no longer needed starting
with version 1.5 of the compilers.


3.02: How do I statically bind Fortran libraries and dynamically
      bind C libraries?
From: amaranth@vela.acs.oakland.edu (Paul Amaranth)

[ Editor's note: Part of this is also discussed above under the C compiler
  section, but I felt it was so valuable that I have left it all in. 
  I've done some minor editing, mostly typographical. ]

The linker and binder are rather versatile programs, but it is not
always clear how to make them do what you want them to.  In particular,
there are times when you do not want to use shared libraries, but
rather, staticly bind the required routines into your object.  Or, you
may need to use two versions of the same routine (eg, Fortran & C).  Here
are the results of my recent experiments.  I would like to thank Daniel
Premer and Brad Hollowbush, my SE, for hints.  Any mistakes or omissions
are my own and I have tended to interchange the terms "linker" and
"binder".  These experiments were performed on AIX 3.1.2.  Most of this
should be applicable to later upgrades of 3.1.

1)  I have some C programs, I want to bind in the runtime routines.  How
    do I do this? [Mentioned in section 2.04 of this article as well, ed.]

    You can put the -bnso binder command on the link line.  You should
    also include the -bI:/lib/syscalls.exp control argument:
      
      $ cc *.o -bnso -bI:/lib/syscalls.exp -o foo

    This will magically do everything you need.  Note that this will bind
    _all_ required routines in.  The -bI argument tells the linker that
    these entry points will be resolved dynamically at runtime (these are
    system calls).  If you omit this you will get lots of unresolved 
    reference messages.

2)  I want to statically bind in the Fortran runtime so a) my customers 
    do not need to buy it and b) I don't have to worry about the runtime
    changing on a new release.  Can I use the two binder arguments in
    1) to do this?

    You should be able to do so, but, at least under 3002, if you do
    you will get a linker error referencing getenv.  In addition, there
    are a number of potential conflicts between Fortran and C routines.
    The easy way just does not work.  See the section on
    2 stage linking for C and Fortran on how to do this.  The getenv
    problem is a mess, see the section on Comments & Caveats for more.

3)  I have a mixture of C and Fortran routines, how can I make sure
    that the C routines reference the C getenv, while the Fortran routines
    reference the Fortran getenv (which has different parameters and, if
    called mistakenly by a C routine results in a segmentation fault)?

    From Mike Heath (mike@pencom.com):

    Use -brename:symbol1,symbol2 when pre-linking the modules from one
    of the languages. It does not matter which one you choose.

4)  I have C and Fortran routines.  I want to bind in the xlf library, while
    letting the rest of the libraries be shared.  How do I do this?

    You need to do a 2 stage link.  In the first stage, you bind in the
    xlf library routines, creating an intermediate object file.  The
    second stage resolves the remaining references to the shared libraries.

    This is a general technique that allows you to bind in specific system
    routines, while still referencing the standard shared libraries.

    Specifically, use this command to bind the xlf libraries to the Fortran
    objects:

       $ ld -bh:4 -T512 -H512 <your objects> -o intermediat.o \
         -bnso -bI:/lib/syscalls.exp -berok -lxlf -bexport:/usr/lib/libg.exp \
         -lg -bexport:<your export file>

    The argument -bexport:<your export file> specifies a file with the
    name of all entry points that are to be visible outside the intermediate 
    module.  Put one entrypoint name on a line.  The -bI:/lib/libg.exp line 
    is required for proper functioning of the program.  The -berok argument 
    tells the binder that it is ok to have unresolved references, at least 
    at this time (you would think -r would work here, but it doesn't seem to).  
    The -bnso argument causes the required modules to be imported
    into the object.  The -lxlf, of course, is the xlf library.

    Then, bind the intermediate object with the other shared libraries in
    the normal fashion:

       $ ld -bh:4 -T512 -H512 <C or other modules> intermediate.o \
         /lib/crt0.o -lm -lc

    Note the absence of -berok.  After this link, all references should
    be resolved (unless you're doing a multistage link and making another
    intermediate).

    NOTE THE ORDER OF MODULES.  This is extremely important if, for example,
    you had a subroutine named "load" in your Fortran stuff.  Putting the
    C libraries before the intermediate module would make the C "load"
    the operable definition, rather than the Fortran version EVEN THOUGH 
    THE FORTRAN MODULE HAS ALREADY BEEN THROUGH A LINK AND ALL REFERENCES 
    TO THE SYMBOL ARE CONTAINED IN THE FORTRAN MODULE.  This can
    be extremely difficult to find (trust me on this one :-)  Is this
    a bug, a feature, or what?
    
    [As mentioned in section 2.03 of this article, it is a feature that you
    can replace individual objects in linked files, ed.]

    The result will be a slightly larger object than normal.  (I say slightly
    because mine went up 5%, but then it's a 2 MB object :-)


Comments & Caveats:

   From the documentation the -r argument to the linker should do what
   -berok does.  It does not.  Very strange results come from using the
   -r argument.  I have not been able to make -r work in a sensible manner
   (even for intermediate links which is what it is supposed to be for).

       Note from Mike Heath (mike@pencom.com):

       'ld -r' is essentially shorthand for 'ld -berok -bnogc -bnoglink'.
       Certainly, using -berok with an export file (so garbage collection
       can be done) is preferable to ld -r, but the latter is easier.

   When binding an intermediate module, use an export file to define the
   entry points you want visible in the later link.  If you don't do this,
   you'll get the dreaded "unresolved reference" error.  Import files name
   entry points that will be dynamically resolved (and possibly where).

   If you are in doubt about what parameters or libraries to link, use the
   -v arg when linking and modify the exec call that shows up into 
   an ld command.  Some thought about the libraries will usually yield an
   idea of when to use what.  If you don't know what an argument is for,
   leave it in.  It's there for a purpose (even if you don't understand it).

   Watch the order of external definitions (ie, libraries) when more than
   one version of a routine may show up, eg "load".  The first one defined
   on the ld command line is the winner.  

   The getenv (and system and signal) problem is a problem that started out
   minor, got somewhat worse in 3003 and, eventually will be correctly fixed.
   Basically, you should extract the 3002 version of these three routines
   from xlf.a before doing the update and save them away, then link these
   routines in if you use these Fortran system services.  


3.03: How do I check if a number is NaN?
From: sdl@glasnost.austin.ibm.com (Stephen Linam)

NaN is "Not a Number".  It arises because the RISC System/6000 uses
IEEE floating point arithmetic.

To determine if a variable is a NaN you can make use of the property
that a NaN does not compare equal to anything, including itself.
Thus, for real variable X, use

	IF (X .NE. X) THEN	! this will be true if X is NaN

Floating point operations which cause exceptions (such as an overflow)
cause status bits to be set in the Floating Point Status and Control
Register (FPSCR).  There is a Fortran interface to query the FPSCR, and
it is described in the XLF Fortran manuals -- I don't have the manuals
right here, but look for FPGETS and FPSETS.

The IBM manual "Risc System/6000 Hardware Technical Reference - General
Information" (SA23-2643) describes what floating point exceptions can
occur and which bits are set in the FPSCR as a result of those exceptions.

   Arithmetic) and ANSI/IEEE STD 854-1987 (IEEE Standard for

4.00: GNU and Public Domain software

GNU software comes from the Free Software Foundation and various other
sources. A number of ftp sites archive them. Read the GNU license for 
rules on distributing their software.

Lots of useful public domain software have been and continue to be ported
to the RS/6000. See below for ftp or download information.


4.01: How do I find sources?
From: jik@GZA.COM (Jonathan Kamens)

There is a newsgroup devoted to posting about how to get a certain
source.  One is strongly urged to follow the guidelines in the article
How_to_find_sources(READ_THIS_BEFORE_POSTING), available via anonymous
ftp from rtfm.mit.edu

/pub/usenet/comp.sources.wanted/H_t_f_s_(R_T_B_P)

Note: You should try to use hostnames rather than ip addresses since
they are much less likely to change.

Also available from mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu by sending a mail
message containing:

send usenet/comp.sources.wanted/H_t_f_s_(R_T_B_P)

Send a message containing "help" to get general information about the
mail server.

If you don't find what you were looking for by following these
guidelines, you can post a message to comp.sources.wanted.


4.02: Are there any ftp sites?

Below are some ftp sites that are supposed to have RS/6000 specific
software.  I haven't verified all the entries.

US sites:
<URL:ftp://aixpdslib.seas.ucla.edu/pub/>		128.97.2.211
<URL:ftp://aix.boulder.ibm.com/>		
<URL:ftp://software.watson.ibm.com/>

European sites:

<URL:ftp://iacrs1.unibe.ch/pub/>			130.92.11.3
<URL:ftp://ftp.zrz.TU-Berlin.DE/pub/aix/>		130.149.4.50
<URL:ftp://ftp-aix.polytechnique.fr/pub/binaries/rios/>	129.104.3.60
<URL:ftp://ftp.uni-stuttgart.de/sw/rs_aix32/>		129.69.8.13

The first one is dedicated to software running on AIX.  It might not
always be the latest versions of the software, but it has been ported
to AIX (normally AIX version 3 only).  Please use the European sites
very sparingly.  They are primarily to serve people in Europe and most
of the software can be found in the US sites originally.

The remaining sites are simply ones that archie indicated contained
AIX related materials.

4.03: Why does "install"ing software I got from the net fail?

This answer was moved to section 2.21


4.04: GNU Emacs

If you get a segmentation fault in GNU EMACS 19.* during hilit19 use,
you can set locale to C (export LC_ALL=C) to get around the AIX bug.

Version 18.57 of GNU Emacs started to have RS/6000 support.  Use
s-aix3-2.h for AIX 3.2. Emacs is going through rapid changes recently.
Current release is 19.x.

Emacs will core-dump if it is stripped, so don't strip when you install
it.  You can edit a copy of the Makefile in src replacing all 'install -s' 
with /usr/ucb/install.


4.05: gcc/gdb

GNU C version 2.0 and later supports the RS/6000, and compiles straight
out of the box.  You may, however, experience that compiling it requires
large amounts of paging space.

Compiling gcc and gdb requires a patch to the 'as' assembler.  Call
IBM software support and request patch for apar IX26107 (U409205).

gcc has undergone many changes lately and the current version is 2.5.x.
gdb is at 4.1x.

If your machine crashed when trying to run gdb 4.7, call software support
and request ptf U412815.


4.06: GNU Ghostscript 

The PostScript interpreter GNU Ghostscript Version 2.3 and later supports
the RS/6000 and can be found on various ftp sites. Current version is 2.6.1.

Compile time problems:
  Compile idict.c and zstack.c _without_ optimization, add the following
  to the Makefile:

  idict.o: idict.c
        $(CC) -c idict.c

  zstack.o: zstack.c
        $(CC) -c zstack.c

Run time problems:
  Running ghostview-1.5 with ghostscript-2.6.1, I get 
   gs: Malformed ghostview color property.
  Solution: replace buggy version of ghostscript-2.6.1 X11 driver
  with at least 2.6.1pl4 

4.07  TeX - Document processing

TeX can be retrieved via ftp from ftp.uni-stuttgart.de.
Be sure to use a recent C compiler (01.02.0000.0013) and you can compile
with optimization.


4.08  Perl - Scripting language

Current version is 4.035 and compiling with cc should give no problems. 
If you use bsdcc, do not use perl's builtin malloc(), edit config.H to
'#define HAS_SYMLINK', and you should be on your way.  Bill Wohler tells
me that perl will run without editing config.H and with cc as well.  So
just say no to use perl's malloc().

Doug Sewell <DOUG@YSUB.YSU.EDU> adds:

In addition to not using the perl-provided malloc, when asked if you
want to edit config.sh, change 'cppstdin' from the wrapper-program
to '/lib/cpp'.

The perl wrapper name is compiled into perl, and requires that you keep
that file in the source directory, even if you blow away the rest of
the source.  /lib/cpp will do the job by itself.  I suspect this will
be fixed in perl 4.0pl11 Configure script.

Also, beware if you have gdbm installed per the instructions in the FAQ.
Gdbm is compiled with bsdcc; perl (as I installed it, anyway) was built
with cc, so I used the IBM-provided ndbm routines.


4.09: X-Windows

IBM has two releases of 3.2.3. The base version has X11R4 and Motif 1.1
and the extended version has X11R5 as AIXwindows 1.2.3.

AIXwindows version 1.2.0 (X11rte 1.2.0) is X11R4 with Motif 1.1
AIXwindows version 1.2.3 (X11rte 1.2.3) is X11R5 with Motif 1.1
X11rte.motif1.2 1.2.3 is Motif 1.2 and requires AIXwindows 1.2.3


4.10  Bash - /bin/ksh alternative from FSF

Bash is an alternative to ksh and is availible from prep.ai.mit.edu
and places that mirror the GNU software.  /etc/security/login.cfg
needs to be modified if this will be used as a default shell.


4.11: Elm

A very nice replacement for mail. Elm should be pretty straightforward,
the only thing to remember is to link with -lcurses as the only
curses/termlib library. You may also run into the problem listed under
point 2.13 above.


4.12: Oberon 2.2

From: afx@muc.ibm.de (Andreas Siegert)

Oberon is Wirth's follow on to Modula-2, but is not compatible. A free
version of Modula-3 is available from DEC/Olivetti at
gatekeeper.dec.com. This is not a Modula-2 replacement but a new
language. There are currently two M2 compilers for the 6000 that I
know of. One from Edinburgh Portable Compilers, +44 31 225 6262 (UK)
and the other from Gardens Point is availible through A+L in
Switzerland (+41 65 520311) or Real Time Associates in the UK
(info@rtal.demon.co.uk).

Oberon can be obtained via anonymous ftp from neptune.inf.ethz.ch
(129.132.101.33) under the directory Oberon/RS6000 or gatekeeper.dec.com
(16.1.0.2).


4.13  Kermit - Communications 

Get it from watsun.cc.columbia.edu (128.59.39.2), kermit/bin/cku189.tar.Z.
Uncompress, untar, and "make rs6000", and it works.


4.14: Gnu dbm
From: doug@cc.ysu.edu (Doug Sewell)

Here's the fixes for RS/6000's:

apply this to testgdbm.c:
158c158
<   char opt;
---
>   int opt;
166c166
<   while ((opt = getopt (argc, argv, "rn")) != -1)
---
>   while ((opt = getopt (argc, argv, "rn")) != EOF)

Apply this to systems.h:
111a112,114
> #ifdef RS6000
> #pragma alloca
> #else
112a116
> #endif

To compile, edit the Makefile.  Set CC to bsdcc (see /usr/lpp/bos/bsdport
if you don't have 'bsdcc' on your system) and set CFLAGS to -DRS6000 and
whatever options (-g, -O) you prefer.  Don't define SYSV.


4.15  tcsh - /bin/ksh alternative
From: cordes@athos.cs.ua.edu (David Cordes)

tcsh is available from tesla.ee.cornell.edu (pub/tcsh-6.00 directory)
Compiles with no problems. You must edit /etc/security/login.cfg to
permit users to change to this shell (chsh), adding the path where the
shell is installed (in my case, /usr/local/bin/tcsh).

From: "A. Bryan Curnutt" <bryan@Stoner.COM>

Under AIX 3.2.5, you need to modify the "config.h" file, changing
    #define BSDSIGS
to
    #undef BSDSIGS


4.16: Kyoto Common Lisp

The sources are available from cli.com. The kcl package is the needed
base; also retrieve the latest akcl distribution. akcl provides a
front-end that "ports" the original kcl to a number of different
platforms. The port to the 6000 worked with no problems. However, you
must be root for make to work properly with some memory protection
routines.


4.17  Tcl/Tk - X-Windows scripting

Current versions: Tcl 7.3, Tk 3.6. Available from sprite.berkeley.edu or
harbor.ecn.purdue.edu.


4.18: Expect
From: Doug Sewell <DOUG@YSUB.YSU.EDU>
   
To build the command-interpreter version, you must have the tcl library
built successfully. The expect library doesn't require tcl.  Note:
Expect and its library are built with bsdcc, so applications using
the library probably also need to be developed with bsdcc.

I ftp'd expect from ftp.cme.nist.gov.

You need to change several lines in the makefile.  First you need
to customize source and target directories and files:
#
TCLHDIR = /usr/include
TCLLIB = -ltcl
MANDIR = /usr/man/manl               (local man-pages)
MANEXT = l
BINDIR = /u/local/bin
LIBDIR = /usr/lib
HDIR = /usr/include
...
Next set the compiler, switches, and configuration options:
#
CC = bsdcc
CFLAGS = -O
...
PTY_TYPE = bsd
...
INTERACT_TYPE = select
...
Then you need to make these changes about line 90 or so:
comment out CFLAGS = $(CLFLAGS)
un-comment these lines:
CFLAGS = $(CLFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS)
LFLAGS = ($CLFLAGS)

Then run 'make'.

You can't run some of the examples without modification (host name,
etc).  I don't remember if I ran all of them or not, but I ran enough
that I was satisfied it worked.


4.19: Public domain software on CD
From: mbeckman@mbeckman.mbeckman.com (Mel Beckman)

The Prime Time Freeware CD collection is a package of two CD's and docs
containing over THREE GIGABYTES of compressed Unix software. It costs $69
>from Prime Time Freeware, 415-112 N. Mary Ave., Suite 50, Sunnyvale, CA
94086. Phone 408-738-4832 voice, 408-738-2050 fax. No internet orders as
far as I can tell.

I've extracted and compiled a number of the packages, and all have worked
flawlessly so far on my 220. Everything from programming languages to 3D
solid modeling is in this bonanza!

Ed: The O'Reilly book, Unix Power Tools, also contains a CD-ROM with lots
of useful programs compiled for the RS/6000, among other platforms.


4.20: Andrew Toolkit

From: Gary Keim <gk5g+@andrew.cmu.edu>

The Andrew Toolkit Consortium of Carnegie Mellon University's School of
Computer Science has released new versions of the Andrew User
Environment, Andrew Toolkit, and Andrew Message System.

The Andrew User Environment (AUE) is an integrated set of applications
beginning with a 'generic object' editor, ez, a help system, a system
monitoring tool (console), an editor-based shell interface (typescript),
and support for printing multi-media documents. 

The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable user-interface toolkit that runs
under X11. It provides a dynamically-loadable object-oriented
environment wherein objects can be embedded in one another. Thus, one
could edit text that, in addition to containing multiple fonts, contains
embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors, equations, simple
animations, etc. These embedded objects can also be nested.

The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface to mail
and bulletin-boards. AMS supports several mail management strategies
and implements many advanced features including authentication, return
receipts, automatic sorting of mail, vote collection and tabulation,
enclosures, audit trails of related messages, and subscription
management. It has interfaces that support ttys, personal computers, 
and workstations.

Release 5.1 of Andrew contains many bug fixes and updates. There is now
support for the new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)
standards for multipart, and multimedia mail. For more information on
MIME, please see the CHANGES files in the ftp directory on
emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu.

This release can be obtained as follows. The sources are available via
anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.30.0.238) in the
./contrib/andrew tree. For details, see ./contrib/andrew/README.

PATCH for AIX3.2: A patch to the AUIS 5.1 sources can be ftp'ed from
emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in ./aixpatch. For those without
internet access, a 3.5" diskette can be ordered for a nominal fee of $10
by sending, or faxing, a purchase order to the Consortium address below.

Andrew, as well as a variety of other CMU software, can also be ftp'ed
>from emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.30.62). Those with AFS access look
at /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/itc/sm/releases/X.V11R5/ftp.

Remote Andrew Demo Service 

This network service allows you to run Andrew Toolkit applications
without obtaining or compiling the Andrew software. You need a host
machine running X11 on the Internet. A simple "finger" command will let
you experience ATK applications firsthand. You'll be able to compose
multimedia documents, navigate through the interactive Andrew Tour, and
use the Andrew Message System to browse through CMU's three thousand
bulletin boards and newsgroups.

To use the Remote Andrew Demo service, run the following command:

    finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu 

The service will give you further instructions.

4.21: sudo

The most recent of sudo is cu-sudo v1.3.1 patchlevel 2
(cu-sudo.v1.3.1pl2.tar.Z).  It support AIX 3.x.  cu-sudo is maintained
by Todd Miller <millert@cs.colorado.edu>.


4.22: Flexfax/HylaFax and other fax software

From: Christian Zahl <czahl@cs.tu-berlin.de>

Sam Leffler has released a new version of FlexFax called HylaFax.  It
is availible from <URL:ftp://sgi.com:/sgi/fax/>. Version 2.2.1
supported many types of Class 1/2 fax modems and several UNIX systems
including AIX 3.2.3 or greater.  There is also a fax modem review
document at the same site as sgi.com:/pub/fax/bakeoff. The FlexFax
related files on sgi.com are replicated on ftp.bsc.no as well.

From: michael@hal6000.thp.Uni-Duisburg.DE (Michael Staats)

We're using mgetty+sendfax for the basic modem I/O, I wrote a printer
backend for the modem so that users can send faxes as easy as they print
postscript. I also wrote a little X interface composer to generate a
fax form that makes sending faxes very easy. You can find these
programs at hal6000.thp.Uni-Duisburg.DE under /pub/source.

4.23  lsof - LiSt Open Files
From: abe@vic.cc.purdue.edu (Vic Abell)

Q. How can I determine the files that a process has opened?
Q. How can I locate the process that is using a specific network address?
Q. How can I locate the processes that have files open on a file system?

A. Use lsof (LiSt Open Files).

Lsof is available via anonymous ftp from vic.cc.purdue.edu
(128.210.15.16) in pub/lsofVVVtar.Z where VVV is the version number,
currently 229.


4.24  popper - POP3 mail daemon

The POP server is available via anonymous ftp from 
ftp.qualcomm.com:/quest/unix/servers/popper
  The makefile supports AIX
ftp.CC.Berkeley.EDU (128.32.136.9, 128.32.206.12).
  There are two versions in the pub directory: a compressed tar file
  popper-version.tar.Z and a Macintosh StuffIt archive in BinHex format
  called MacPOP.sit.hqx.

Problems building some versions of popper can sometimes be resolved by
compiling with bsdcc or -D_BSD.


4.26: mpeg link errors version 2.0
posted by (Nathan Lane) nathan@seldon.foundation.tricon.com 

.XShmCreateImage
.XShmDetach
.XShmAttach
.XShmGetEventBase
.XShmPutImage
.XShmQueryExtension

... are for the Shared Memory extension of the X server.
You can either choose to build it with shared memory or without.  I
always do it without the performance increase is not really
incredible, except on something like a 2x0 machine with the local bus
graphics adapter.  Just take out "DSH_MEM" in the CFLAGS in the
makefile for mpeg_play.  There is more information about shared memory
link errors in section 1.513.

Also, in the module "video.c" for mpeg_play it will complain about not
having enough memory to fully optimize one of the loops.  You can get
around that by specificying "qmaxmem=8000" in your cflags line, BUT,
the extra optimization does little good in my tests.


4.27: NNTP, INN

Link errors compiling nntp may occur because your machine lacks the
"patch" command.  Patch can be obtained from GNU repositories


4.28: Zmodem - File transfer

RZSZ is Chuck Forsberg's script for Z-modem. It is available by ftp at
<URL:ftp://oak.oakland.edu/pub/unix-c/xyzmodem/rzdsz.tar.Z> or
directly from Forsberg at Omen Technology BBS at 503-621-3746.

Hints:
0. Build with "make posix"
1. Use rlogin, not telnet
2. Set the system to be transparent, I use "terminal download" 
3. Ensure hardware flow-control

4.29: Patch - automated file updates

AIX 3.2.5 does not ship with patch, a utility to apply the differences
between two files to make them identical.  This tool is often used to
update source code.

<URL:ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/R6untarred/xc/util/patch/>

5.00: Third party products

[ Ed.: Entries in this section are edited to prevent them from looking
  like advertising. Prices given may be obsolete. Companies mentioned
  are for reference only and are not endorsed in any fashion. ]


5.02: Disk/Tape/SCSI
From: anonymous

- Most SCSI disk drives work (IBM resells Maxtor, tested Wren 6&7 myself);
  use osdisk when configuring (other SCSI disk).

- Exabyte: Unfortunately only the ones IBM sells are working.
  A few other tape drives will work; 
  use ostape when configuring (other SCSI tape).

- STK 3480 "Summit": Works with Microcode Version 5.2b


From: bell@hops.larc.nasa.gov (John Bell)
               
In summary, third party tape drives work fine with the RS/6000 unless 
you want to boot from them. This is because IBM drives have 'extended 
tape marks', which IBM claims are needed because the standard marks 
between files stored on the 8mm tape are unreliable. These extended 
marks are used when building boot tapes, so when the RS/6000 boots, it 
searches for an IBM tape drive and refuses to boot without it.

From: jrogers@wang.com (John Rogers)

On booting with non-IBM SCSI tape drives: I haven't tried it myself but
someone offered:

Turn machine on with key in secure position.
Wait until LED shows 200 and 8mm tape has stopped loading.
Turn key to service position.


From: amelcuk@gibbs.clarku.edu (Andrew Mel'cuk)

The IBM DAT is cheap and works.  If you get all the patches beforehand
(U407435, U410140) and remember to buy special "Media Recognition
System" tapes (Maxell, available from APS 800.443.4461 or IBM #21F8758)
the drive can even be a pleasure to use.  You can also flip a DIP switch
on the drive to enable using any computer grade DAT tapes (read the
hardware service manual).

Other DAT drives also work.  I have tried the Archive Python (works) and
experimented extensively with the Archive TurboDAT.  The TurboDAT is a
very fast compression unit, is not finicky with tapes and doesn't
require the many patches that the IBM 7206 does.  Works fine with the
base AIX 3.2 'ost' driver.


From: pack@acd.ucar.edu (Daniel Packman)

>>You can boot off of several different brands of non-IBM Exabytes.
>>At least TTI and Contemporary Cybernetics have done rather complete
>>jobs of emulating genuine IBM products.

A model that has worked for us from early AIX 3.1 through 3.2 is a TTI
CTS 8210.  This is the old low density drive.  The newer 8510 is dual
density (2.2gig and 5gig).  Twelve dip switches on the back control the
SCSI address and set up the emulation mode.  These drives have a very
useful set of lights for read-outs (eg, soft error rate, tape remaining,
tape motion, etc.).


5.03: Memory

I got a flyer from Nordisk Computer Services (Portland 503-598-0111, 
Seattle 206-242-7777).  Some sample prices:

      16 MB Upgrade Kit   $  990
      32 MB Upgrade Kit   $1,700
      64 MB Upgrade Kit   $3,300

5xx machines have 8 memory slots, 3x0s have 2, and 3x5s have only one.
You need to add memory in pairs for the 5xx machines excepting the 520.

Models 220, 230 and 250 can use "PS/2" style SIMM memory.  All have 8
SIMM sockets.  60ns or better is needed for the 250, 70ns should be OK
in the 220 and 230.  The 220 and 230 are limited to 64MB of memory,
the 250 is limited to 256MB.

6.00: Miscellaneous other stuff

6.01: Can I get support by e-mail?

According to kwedar@vnet.IBM.COM AIXServ is no longer free and that
"mail -s'AIX Program Services' aixsupt@aix.boulder.ibm.com" is your
best bet for no-fee support.  The rest of this information may be
outdated and will be removed if it is confirmed.

AIXServ is a service tool that allows users on internet and usenet to
report problems via unix mail. AIXServ is free. To receive instructions 
on using AIXServ, send a note with "Subject: package" to one of the
following e-mail addresses:

	Usenet:     uunet.UU.NET!aixserv!aixbugs
	Internet:   aixbugs@austin.ibm.com     (transactions request)
                    services@austin.ibm.com    (administrivia)
                    aasc@austin.ibm.com        (test cases under 100KB)

Using AIXServ, customers have the ability to 1) open new problem reports,
2) update existing problem records, and 3) request a status update on an
existing problem record. Currently this service is available to United
States customers only.

Canada:

Gary Tomic mentioned that Canadian customers can get support from their
BBS, cac.toronto.ibm.com at 142.77.253.16.

Germany:

Thomas Braunbeck reported that German customers with ESS (extended
software service) contracts can get support by e-mail too. They can 
obtain information by sending mail with Subject: help to 
aixcall@aixserv.mainz.ibm.de.

Various flavors of service offerings are available. Contact your IBM rep
for details.

6.04: Some RS232 hints
From: graeme@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz, sactoh0.SAC.CA.US!jak

Q: How do you connect a terminal to the RS232 tty ports when not using
   the standard IBM cable & terminal transposer?
A: 1- Connect pins 2->3, 3->2, 7->7 on the DB25's
   2- On the computer side, most of the time cross 6->20 (DSR, DTR).
      Some equipment may require connecting 6, 8, and 20 (DSR, DCD, DTR).

Also, pin 1 (FG) should be a bare metal wire and the cable should be
shielded with a connection all the way through. Most people don't run
pin 1 because pins 1 & 7 (SG) are jumpered on many equipment.

When booting from diskettes, the port speed is always 9600 baud.  If you
use SMIT to set a higher speed (38400 is nice) for normal use, remember
to reset your terminal before booting.

Q: How do you connect a printer to the RS232 tty ports
A: 1- Connect pins 2->3, 3->2, 7->7 on the DB25's
   2- On the computer side, loop pins 4->5 (CTS & RTS)
