Other Graphics-related FAQs and FAQ-like documents

   The comp.graphics FAQ attempts to cover a wide range of material. If
   you don't find what you need here, try one of these more focused
   documents.
   
   comp.graphics.algorithms FAQ
          Maintained by Jon Stone (jdstone@destin.dazixco.ingr.com), the
          comp.graphics.algorithms FAQ contains questions and answers
          about computer graphics algorithms. There is some overlap
          between this document and the one you are reading, for
          historical reasons. It is available on rtfm.mit.edu as
          /pub/usenet/news.answers/graphics/algorithms-faq.
          
   comp.graphics.animation FAQ
          Maintained by Francisco X DeJesus (dejesus@vislab.navy.mil),
          the comp.graphics.animation FAQ contains questions and answers
          about computer graphics animation. He maintains a HTML version
          at http://www.ridgecrest.ca.us/fx/cga-faq.html. The non-HTML
          version is still available on rtfm.mit.edu as
          /pub/usenet/news.answers/graphics/animation-faq.
          
   Graphics File Formats FAQ
          Maintained by James Murray (jdm@netcom.com), the Graphics File
          Formats FAQ contains information on graphics file formats,
          including raster, vector, metafile, PDL, 3D object, animation,
          and multimedia formats. It is available on rtfm.mit.edu as
          /pub/usenet/news.answers/graphics/fileformats-faq.
          
   Color Space FAQ
          Maintained by David Bourgin (david.bourgin@ufrima.imag.fr), the
          Color Space FAQ contains questions and answers about colors and
          color spaces. It is available on rtfm.mit.edu as
          /pub/usenet/news.answers/graphics/colorspace-faq.
          
   Frequently Asked Questions about Gamma and Colour
          Charles Poynton has written FAQs on Gamma and Color Spaces. His
          FAQs are available from his web page,
          http://www.inforamp.net/~poynton/ in a variety of formats. Text
          versions may be obtained at ftp.inforamp.net in the
          /pub/users/poynton/doc/colour directory.
          
   Computer Graphics Resource Listing
          Maintained by Nick Fotis (nfotis@theseas.ntua.gr), the CGRL
          contains questions and answers about general graphics
          documents, sort of like this document. It came into existence
          for political reasons. There is no clear division of
          responsibility between his document and mine, but I do tend to
          keep this one a bit more terse and free of commercial material.
          As a result, the CGRL is much larger and is stored in six
          parts. You can get the parts at rtfm.mit.edu as
          /pub/usenet/news.answers/graphics/resources-list/part[1-6], or
          get the auto-HTMLed version at

  RAY-TRACING AND GLOBAL ILLUMINATION
  
   Rick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography. The bib
   is in the form of a PostScript file. The printout is 41 pages long. It
   may be found on wuarchive.wustl.edu as
   /graphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/speer.rt.bib.ps.Z, and on
   plaza.aarnet.edu.au as
   /graphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/speer.rt.bib.ps.gz.
   
   While useful, this document has not been updated since 1991. Is there
   a more recent version out there somewhere that I don't know about?
   
   Ian Ashdown maintains ray tracing and radiosity/global illumination
   bibliographies. These are in "refer" format, and so can be searched
   electronically (a simple awk script to search for keywords is included
   with each). The bibliographies have been combined, and are available
   on hobbes.lbl.gov as /pub/doc/RadBib95.Z. There are also some other
   interesting papers in the same directory.
   
   Tom Wilson (twilson@dab.ge.com) has collected over 300 abstracts from
   ray tracing related research papers and books. The information is
   essentially in plaintext, and Latex formatting programs are included.
   This collection is available at most of the sites mentioned above as
   "rtabs.*".
   
  GRAPHICS FILE FORMATS
  
     * Graphics File Formats, David Kay and John Levine,

       ISBN 0-8306-3059-7 $24.95 paper. Comments - 26 formats, no
       software (this is good, IMHO - I prefer books which are not
       platform-dependent). Questions about this book may be sent to
       gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us.
     * Programming for Graphics Files in C and C++, by John Levine, J.
       Wiley & Sons, 1994, ISBN 0-471-59854-2 $29.95 softcover. A good
       complement to Kay & Levine's book: less text info about the
       formats, but working code (IBM PC code) is given for many of the
       basic operations for each type of format. Diskette can be ordered
       separately.
     * Encyclopedia of Graphics File Formats by James D. Murray and
       William vanRyper, O'Reilly & Associates, Sebastopol, CA July,
       1994, 900 pages, $59.95 (includes a CD-ROM) Softcover ISBN:
       1-56592-058-9, Email: orders@ora.com. Good introduction to
       graphics file format issues for both vector and raster formats,
       plus specific descriptions of nearly 100 file formats. CD-ROM
       includes sample images, original format spec documents where
       available, and C code snippets. Also a lot of free and shareware
       image conversion/manipulation software for Unix, DOS, Windows, and
       Mac. Much of this is available on the net (and indeed the book
       tells you where), but having it all pulled together is very
       useful. Tom Lane (tgl@sss.pgh.pa.us) says: "My only complaint is
       that there are too many typos in the printed text. Check the
       original spec document whenever you find something unclear or
       dubious."

   one. Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and
   morphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from
   marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au in the directory
   pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:
   
     * /pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph/morph_intro.ps.Z (PostScript
       version, many pictures)
     * /pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph/morph_intro.txt.Z (text version)
     * /pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph/m_responses.Z (Responses to
       morphing questions)
       
   The files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and
   uncompress them afterwards.

How do I ...

   This section provides brief answers to some of the most frequently
   asked how-to questions. More verbose answers can generally be found in
   the literature mentioned in the General References section.
   
  HOW DO I DRAW 3D OBJECTS ON A 2D SCREEN?
  
   There are many ways to do this. Some approaches map the viewing
   rectangle onto the scene, by shooting rays through each pixel center
   and assigning color according to the object hit by the ray. Other
   approaches map the scene onto the viewing rectangle, by drawing each
   object into the region, keeping track of which object is in front of
   which.
   
   The mapping mentioned above is also referred to as a "projection", and
   the two most popular projections are perspective projection and
   parallel projection. For example, to do a parallel projection of a
   scene onto a viewing rectangle, you can just discard the Z coordinate
   (divide by depth), and "clip" the objects to the viewing rectangle
   (discard portions that lie outside the region).
   
   For details on 3D rendering, the Foley, van Dam, Feiner and Hughes
   book, "Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice" would be a good
   place to start reading. Chapter 6 is "Viewing in 3D", and chapter 15
   is "Visible-Surface Determination". For more information go to chapter
   16 for shading, chapter 19 for clipping, and branch out from there.
   
  HOW DO I QUANTIZE 24-BIT IMAGES DOWN TO 8 BITS?
  
   Find a copy of "Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display" by
   Paul Heckbert, SIGGRAPH '82 Proceedings, page 297. There are other
   algorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple.
   Implementations are included in most raster toolkits (check out the
   various free image manipulation software available).
   
   A variant method is described in "Graphics Gems", p. 287-293 (but no
   code), and there is further information in "Graphics Gems II", p.
   126-133 (code available online but not in book). Spencer Thomas'
   article in Gems II on Efficient Inverse Color Map Computation (p.
   116-125) is also relevant, and code is provided in the book and
   online, as well as in the Utah Raster Toolkit. Note that the code from
   the "Graphics Gems" series is all available from an FTP site, as
   described above.
   
   Also check out John Bradley's "Diversity Algorithm", which is
   incorporated into the xv package and described in the back of the
   manual.
   
   The ImageMagick package contains another quantizing algorithm which is
   presented as "doing a better job than the other algorithms, but
   slower".
   
   Ian Ashdown (Ledalite@mindlink.bc.ca) is maintaining a bibliography of
   color quantization papers and articles that is available at
   hobbes.lbl.gov as /pub/doc/cquant95.Z. It includes both the original
   presentations of the algorithms and their implementation in popular
   computer magazines such as Dr. Dobb's Journal and The C/C++ Users
   Journal.
   
  HOW DO I CONVERT COLOR TO GRAYSCALE?
  
   The NTSC formula is:
   
   luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue
   
   For additional information, please refer to the Color Space FAQ.
   
  HOW DO I CONVERT GRAYSCALE TO BLACK & WHITE?
  
   The definitive book on the topic:
   
     * Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press 1987, ISBN
       0-262-21009-6
       
   But before you go off and start coding, check out the variety of free
   image manipulation software available. Almost all of the packages
   mentioned can do some form of gray to b&w conversion.
   
   For additional information, please refer to the Color Space FAQ.
   
  HOW DO I ROTATE A RASTER IMAGE BY AN ARBITRARY ANGLE?
  
   The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source
   image, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the
   destination. This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.
   Instead, loop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the
   *reverse* transformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from
   the source. This method is quite general, and can be used for any
   one-to-one 2-D mapping, not just rotation. You can add anti-aliasing
   by doing sub-pixel sampling.
   
   However, there is a much faster method, with antialising included,
   which involves doing three shear operations. The method was originally
   created for the IM Raster Toolkit; an implementation is also present
   in PBMPLUS. Reference: A Fast Algorithm for Raster Rotation", by Alan
   Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics Interface '86
   (Vancouver). An article on the IM Raster Toolkit appears in the same
   journal. An updated version of the rotation paper appears in "Graphics
   Gems" under the original title.
   
  HOW DO I DRAW A CIRCLE AS A BEZIER (OR B-SPLINE) CURVE?
  
   The short answer is, "You can't." Unless you use a rational spline you
   can only approximate a circle. The approximation may look acceptable,
   but it is sensitive to scale. Magnify the scale and the error of
   approximation magnifies. Deviations from circularity that were not
   visible in the small can become glaring in the large. If you want to
   do the job right, consult the article:
   
   "A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles" by Leslie Piegl and Wayne

  HOW DO I TELL WHETHER A POINT IS WITHIN A PLANAR POLYGON?
  
   Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to
   infinity. If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way,
   the point is within the polygon. If the ray crosses an even number of
   edges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior
   hole formed from intersecting polygon edges. This idea is known in the
   trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines' article in
   Glassner's ray tracing book (above) for more information, including
   treatment of special cases.
   
   Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the
   vertices on the polygon. If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside, if
   the sum is 0 the point is outside. However, this method is about an
   order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating
   the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly.
   
   Code for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found
   in the Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu
   as /pub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.
   
   This code has been updated and expanded. A long article on the topic
   appears in _Graphics Gems IV_ and the code (along with a timing test
   program) is available from princeton.edu as
   /pub/Graphics/GraphicsGems/GemsIV/GGemsIV.tar.Z.
   
  HOW DO I TESSELLATE A SPHERE?
  
   One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles. The base
   of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides each
   triangle into four smaller ones. Jon Leech has posted a nice routine
   called sphere.c that generates the coordinates. It's available for FTP
   on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.
   
  HOW DO I RAY-TRACE HEIGHT FIELDS?
  
   Height fields are a special case in ray-tracing. They have a number of
   uses, such as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.
   Thus, they get their own FAQ section. Note that further references can
   no doubt be located via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above.
   
   The following paper seems to be the definitive reference: "Grid
   Tracing: Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields", F. Kenton Musgrave,
   July, 1988.
   
   This is available as "Research Report YALEU/DCS/RR-639" from Yale
   University, it's also in the SIGGRAPH '91 Fractal Modeling in 3D
   Computer Graphics and Imaging course notes, and (best of all) it's
   available on the net, at princeton.edu, as
   /pub/Graphics/Papers/musg88.ms.Z.
   
   An implementation of this paper may be found in Rayshade.
   
   Another paper exists: "Parametric Height Field Ray Tracing", D. W.
   Paglieroni, S. M. Peterson, Proceedings of Graphics Interface '92,
   Canadian Information Processing Society, Toronto, Ontario, May 1992,
   p. 192-200

   Terrains", Musgrave, Kolb, Mace, Computer Graphics Vol 23, No. 3
   (SIGGRAPH '89 Proceedings) p. 41-50
   
  HOW DO I FIND THE AREA OF A 3D POLYGON?
  
   The area of a triangle is given by (in C notation)

     area = 0.5 * ( ( x[0] * y[1] ) + ( x[1] * y[2] ) + ( x[2] * y[0] ) -
                    ( x[1] * y[0] ) - ( x[2] * y[1] ) - ( x[0] * y[2] ) );

   
   
   and the area of a planar polygon is given by

     area = 0.0;

     for ( i = 0; i <n - 1; i++ )
         area += ( x[i] * y[i + 1] ) - ( x[i + 1] * y[i] );
     area += ( x[n - 1] * y[0] ) - ( x[0] * y[n - 1] );
     area /= 2.0;

   
   
   or, equivalently but more quickly

    area = 0.0;

    for ( i = 0; i <n - 1; i++ )
        area += ( x[i] - x[i + 1] ) * ( y[i + 1] + y[i] );
    area += ( x[n - 1] - x[0] ) * ( y[0] + y[n - 1] );
    area /= 2.0;

   
   
   If the area is a negative number, the polygon or triangle is
   clockwise, if positive, it is counterclockwise.
   
   From Ronald Goldman's Gem (in Graphics Gems II - see section 1 above),
   "Area of Planar Polygons and Volume of Polyhedra:"
   
   The area of a polygon P0, P1, P2, ... Pn, not in the x-y plane, is
   given by

     Area(Polygon) = 1/2 * | N . Sigma { Pk x Pk+1 } |

   
   
   where N is the unit vector normal to the plane and P is a polygonal
   vertex. The . represents the dot product operator and the x represents
   the cross product operator. Sigma represents the summation operator. |
   | represents the absolute value operator. Pn+1 is equal to P0.
   
  HOW DO I CONVERT BETWEEN VECTOR FORMATS?
  
   A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or
   MacDraw to CGM, or whatever. It is important to understand that this
   is a very different problem from that addressed by the free image
   manipulation software below. Converting one image format to another is
   a fairly easy problem, since once you get past all the file header
   junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects are the same for all
   image formats. This is not so for vector formats. The basic objects --
   circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled round-cornered
   rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another. Except in
   extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do a
   one-to-one conversion between vector formats.
   
   On the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,
   rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.
   As far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such
   converters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been
   posted to comp.sources.misc. Check the index on your nearest archive
   site.
   
   A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format
   to a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL
   to X11 bitmap. For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones
   for PC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.
   Also, the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's
   X11/NeWs can be used to render to a file if you're clever. But in
   general, the answer is no. However, if someone were to put together a
   vector to vector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster
   converter would be trivial.
   
   GNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.6.1) includes
   drivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as a
   PostScript to ppm or a PostScript to GIF filter. (It implements
   essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript
   and level 2).
   
   There is a package called hp2xx, which includes a fairly nice HP-GL
   previewer/converter, and which can convert to several formats,
   including PBM. The latest version is hp2xx-3.1.2.tar. It's available
   on many archive sites.
   
  HOW DO I GET FILES IF I CAN'T FTP?
  
   There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups
   and make them available via an email query system. You send a message
   to an automated server saying something like "send
   comp.sources.unix/fbm", and a few hours or days later you get the file
   in the mail.
   
   In addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server. Send mail to
   ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying "help" and it will tell you how to use
   it. Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.
   
   
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Where can I get ...

   This section provides information on how to obtain frequently sought
   items. I tend to shy away from commercial products other than books so
   as to remain as neutral as possible. I don't want to see things like
   "... the paint program recommended in the comp.graphics FAQ!" get a
   toe-hold in my reality. :-)
   
  WHERE CAN I GET FORMAT DOCUMENTS FOR TIFF, IFF, GIF, ETC.?
  
   You almost certainly don't need these due to the existence of a large
   quantity of very good free image manipulation software. Get one or
   more of these packages and look through them. Chances are excellent
   that the image converter you were going to write is already there.
   
   But if you still want one of the format documents, many such files are
   available by anonymous ftp from the following sites:
   
     * zamenhof.cs.rice.edu:/pub/graphics.formats
     * ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu:/misc/file.formats/graphics.formats
     * telva.ccu.uniovi.es:/pub/graphics/file.formats
     * peipa.essex.ac.uk:/ipa/file-formats
     * avalon.vislab.navy.mil:/pub/format_specs
       
   There are many files in each of these directories. Your best bet is to
   go there and look around.
   
   FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. It's a file format
   most often used in astronomy. Despite the name, it can contain not
   only images but other things as well. There is a regular monthly FITS
   basics and information posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want
   to know more.
   
  WHERE CAN I GET FREE IMAGE MANIPULATION SOFTWARE?
  
   There are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to
   another, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus
   the above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions.
   
   While there is a full URL listed for many of these packages, this is
   really quite misleading. Most of these packages are available from
   numerouse sites. I highly recommend two things:
   
    1. Use archie or a similar tool to locate an ftp site close to you,
       rather than fighting the frothing hordes for access to wuarchive.
    2. ftp to your chosen site manually, change to the directory listed
       in the FAQ for your chosen package, and look around. You will
       often find newer versions or additional, related files.
       
   That being said, here are the packages:
   
   xv by John Bradley
          X-based image display, manipulation, and format conversion

          an FTP version will appear someday.
          
          Ed. Note: This is a very old blurb. Is this kit available on
          the net? If so, where? If not, how does one get it? Is it

Graphics-related Mailing Lists

   There are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there, each
   covering either a single product or a single topic. I have been an
   active participant in several of these for some time now, and find the
   focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic
   to be nothing short of amazing.

SIGGRAPH

   SIGGRAPH, the Special Interest Group for Graphics of the Association
   for Computing Machinery, is the premiere professional organization in
   the computer graphics world. It is so active and so pervasive that I
   feel it deserves its own section.
   
  SIGGRAPH INFORMATION ONLINE
  
   ACM-SIGGRAPH provides an online information site at siggraph.org
   (128.248.245.250). This site provides SIGGRAPH information via both
   anonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server.
   
   The anonymous ftp service is very standard, and the ftp directory
   includes both conference and publications subdirectories.
   
   To retrieve information by electronic mail, send mail to
   archive-server@siggraph.org and in the subject or the body of the
   message include the message send followed by the topic and subtopic
   you wish. A good place to start is with the command send index which
   will give you an up-to-date list of available information.
   
   The coolest way to get SIGGRAPH info, of course, is via their WWW page
   at http://www.siggraph.org.
   
  HOW TO JOIN ACM/SIGGRAPH
  
   Probably the easiest way to join ACM/SIGGRAPH is to trot over to your
   local technical library and find a copy of Communications of the ACM.
   Somewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank.
   Fill it out and mail it in. ACM membership for students costs $24.00,
   Voting or Associate Membership $79.00 (yearly).
   
   SIGGRAPH student membership costs an additional $50.00, $59.00 for
   Voting or Associate Members (also yearly). To get TOG (Transactions on
   Graphics) it's another $27.00 for students and $32.00 for Voting or
   Associate Members (TOG is an ACM publication, not a SIGGRAPH
   publication).
   
   If you just want to join SIGGRAPH without joining ACM, it'll cost you
   $85.00 (no student discount).
   
   There are surcharges for overseas airmailing of publications.
   
   ACM Member services may be contacted via email at
   acmhelp@acmvm.bitnet. Their phone number is (212) 626-0500. FAX number
   (212) 944-1318. Snailmail address ACM, PO Box 12114, Church Street
   Station, NY, NY 10257
   
   SIGGRAPH `95 will be held in Los Angeles, California, August 6-11,
   1995.
   
  SIGGRAPH ONLINE BIBLIOGRAPHY PROJECT
  
   The ACM SIGGRAPH Online Bibliography Project is a database of over
   15,000 unique computer graphics and computational geometry references
   in BibTeX format, available to the computer graphics community as a
   research and educational resource.
   
   The database is located at "siggraph.org". Users may download the
   BibTeX files via FTP and peruse them offline, or telnet to
   "siggraph.org" and log in as "biblio" and interactively search the
   database for entries of interest, by keyword.
   
   Web users may also access the SIGGRAPH Online Bibliography Project via
   the URL http://www.siggraph.org
   http://siggraph.org/library/bibliography/bibliography.html.
   
   Additions/corrections/suggestions may be directed to the admin,
   "bibadmin@siggraph.org".
