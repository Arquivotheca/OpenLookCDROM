Archive-name: editor-faq/VI-Archive-filelist



The VI-Archive is divided into three parts:

   1. Documents and introductions.
   2. Comp.Editor disscussions.
   3. Macros.

Part 1 consist mainly of stuff that is explisit written for VI, but
       you can aslo find Comp.Editors thread in this area. This is
       also the Top-Level area in the VI archives.

Part 2 contains comp.editors threads mainly. Looking here is like
       looking for FAQ's on VI.

Part 3 the "old" macro directory.


FTP:
  Remeber that those who allow anonymous-ftp are very kind. Please do 
  not misuse or abuse YOUR privilegde using anonymous FTP.
  Think twice before fetching, esp if you are a long-distance ftp'er.

  If you are going to use FTP, use the site that is the closest to you
  counting NET-VICE. If you don't know what I'm talking about, please 
  ask someone who know (ie. your system administrator).
  IF YOU HAVE FTP-ACCESS, DO *NOT* USE THE MAILSERVER. Not even if you
  temporarly cannot reach the ftp-sites.
  The mirroring sites are always updated.

  Why YOU shold use the site closest to you NET-VICE:
	- Faster access.
	- Reducing the net load.
	- Keeping the site.

  The main archive is in Bergen, Norway, EUROPE. 
  alf.uib.no is mirrored thru sites around the world. 
  Please use the site closest to you.
  The mirroing sites are ALWAYS updated.

  Please do NOT use ftp to the sites during peak hours at the various 
  locations. Please respect this or else, if there is too much FTP'ing 
  going on prime time to the various places, the ftp site may have to 
  shut down.  NON OF US WOULD WANT THAT, WOULD WE ?

EMAIL:
  I have built a Tiny Little Mailserver. This mailserver will send files to
  those with NO FTP-access at all.
  The mailservers adress is ruben@uib.no, the same adress wich is in the
  Reply-To: field.
  To get a file from the mailserver put the keyword GET in the subject line.
  Example:   
      Subject: GET vi.passwd.Z   

  To get files in the macro area, put macros/ before the filname.
  Example:
      Subject: GET macros/upcase

  The Mailserver will only understand the GET command.
  The Mailserver will send a Controll File for each file requested. The
  controll file will give you status information about your request.
  The mailserver can only handle ONE FILE PER REQUEST. If you want more than
  one file, send several Emails.
  DO NOT request the whole archive! If you request the whole archive I'm 
  going to mail your admin about it. If you want the whole archive, request
  a small amounts (max 10) of files everyday. 
  Before fetching a file, think: "Do I realy need this file, or is it just
  'nice to have it' ?"
  All files will be run thru uuencode(1) before mailed, even textfiles.
  If you do not get a reply withing reasonable time, please do not send
  more request about the file(s). The mailserver is probaly down if this
  happends. If the server is down, it will be restarted withing 24 hours. 

  BEWARE: If the mailserver DOES NOT UNDERSTAND the receiptent-adress,
          no mail will be forwarded. The maintainer does NOT have the
          time to manualy process badly formed adresses.


CONTRIBUTION:
  If you have stuff about ex/vi, macros, tips and tricks, plase email it to 
  Ruben@uib.no for inclusion in the archive.

* DO  *_N_O_T_*  try to fetch this file via the Email interface. Most UUCP
  mailers do NOT like files with more than 100000 bytes. A uuencoded version
  of this file is 2833 lines long and 175445 bytes big. The contenst of this
  tar archive is spread around as several files. I will under NO circumstances
  ever implement a mail spliting in the mailserver. I have other more usefull
  things to do.


Beginner's in VI should fetch the following files
