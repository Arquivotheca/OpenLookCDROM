What is the group comp.editors about ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Comp.editors is an INET group for the discussion of editors, editing
interfaces and internals generally. For discussion of what an INET
group is, please see the regular postings in news.announce.newusers.
There was discussion some time back about making comp.editors into a
regular usenet group, but so far nothing has come of it.

If, however, you are interested in "EMACS", a very special editor,
then you should look at (and post to) these groups:
   comp.emacs
   gnus.emacs.help
However, if the question is about an emacs in relation to another type
of editor, then its probably ok to post it here.

There was 4 regular postings to this group:

  - List of EMACS implementations (Posted every 2. month).
  - The INDEX files in the VI/EX archives around the world (Posted monthly).
  - FAQ for Comp.Editors.

The two following FAQ is looking for a new home:
  - List of editors.
