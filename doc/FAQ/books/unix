outermost Portal of the True Enlightenment.

If thou desirest with True Desire to tread the Path of Wizardly Wisdom, first
learn the elementary Postures of Kernighan & Pike's _The_Unix_Programming_
Environment_; then, absorb the mantic puissance of March Rochkind's _Advanced_
Unix_Programming_ and W. Richard Stevens's _Advanced_Programming_In_The_UNIX_
Environment_.  Immerse thyself, then, in the Pure Light of Maurice J.  Bach's
_The_Design_Of_The_UNIX_Operating_System_.  Neglect not the Berkelian Way;
study also _The_Design_Of_The_4.3BSD_UNIX_Operating System_ by Samuel Leffler,
Kirk McKusick et. al.  For useful hints, tips, and tricks, see _UNIX_Power_
Tools_, Tim O'Reilly, ed.  Consider also the dark Wisdom to be gained from
contemplation of the dread _Portable_C_And_UNIX_Systems_Programming_*, e'en
though it hath flowed from the keyboard of the mad and doomed Malvernite whom
the world of unknowing Man misnames "J. E. Lapin".

[ * Portable C and Unix System Programming  was published by Prentice Hall
   (Edition: 1987, ISBN: 0-13-686494-5) ]

These tomes shall instruct thy Left Brain in the Nature of the UNIX System;
to Feed the other half of thy Head, O Nobly Born, embrace also the Lore
of its Nurture.  Don Libes's and Sandy Ressler's _Life_With_UNIX_ will
set thy Feet unerringly upon that Path; take as thy Travelling Companion
the erratic but illuminating compendium called _The_New_Hacker's_Dictionary_
(Eric S. Raymond, ed., with Guy L. Steele Jr.).

(In this wise shalt thou travel the Way of the Camel.)
