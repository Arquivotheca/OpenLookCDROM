I wrote a TNT version of my LiamPaintRoot program.  This draws the most
fantastic random squiggles in a window.  There's a menu that lets you
select the max. number of points in a squiggle.  I might try and add features -
at the very least Print, Properties and Save - next time round, so mail
me if you hack it.
