There is one glaring ommission from your announcement, and that's TNT,
The NeWS Toolkit, which last I heard from Steve MacKay and Scott
McNealy, was one of Sun's supported Open Look toolkits.  There was no
mention of TNT in Sun's announcement about Display PostScript.  Has
there been an official announcement about Sun's support for TNT?  I
have developed and worked with several products based on TNT,
including HyperLook and SimCity, so I would like to know.  What are
companies who have NeWS products, like Aldus, Frame, the Turing
Institute, and DUX Software, supposed to do?  I used to work on TNT at
Sun, but I resigned my job because I did not believe Steve MacKay and
Scott McNealy were telling the truth when they said they would support
it, and they expected me to pass that lie onto the customers, like
Frame and Turing.  I am afraid that Sun is going to change their tune
on XView and OLIT, the same way they flip-flopped on TNT.  So would
you please address the following questions:

   Q1. Is TNT still supported by SunSoft?
   Q2. Will there be more releases of TNT?
   Q3. I've heard that TNT may no longer be shipped after this year.
       Is this true?
   Q4. When will TNT be EOLed?
   Q5. Will TNT source ever be publicly available?
   Q6. Will there be any new features added to TNT?
   Q7. Should I rewrite my application in DPS?
   Q8. Is there a significant engineering effort behind TNT?
   Q9. What is Sun's current feeling about NeWS?
