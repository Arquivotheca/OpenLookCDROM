This is a collection of public domain NeWS software,
maintained by Don Hopkins (don@brillig.umd.edu). 

The up-to-date collection is available via anonymous ftp from
tumtum.cs.umd.edu (128.8.128.49).

Contributions are greatly appreciated.
Please put a copyright notice on your software specifying the terms
under which it can be redistributed (unrestricted redistribution, please!),
and fill out and mail to me a Sun Users Group contribution form (in the
file Contribution-Form), so your software can go on the SUG donated 
software tape.

Lots of these programs were sent to the NeWS-makers mailing list or
the comp.windows.news USENET newsgroup (which carry the same traffic).
Subscribe to the newsgroup if you can, or send mail to
NeWS-makers-REQUEST@brillig.umd.edu, to be added to the mailing list.
