  The pseudo-color visual can be made the default visual by setting the
  environment variable USE_MIT_VISUALS (to some value, say "t") before
  starting the server.  The problem with this is that NeWS programs think
  that the default visual is static.  This is not generally too bad, but
  the cursor seems to be solid black.  This is documented in the man page
  for xnews.

NeWS programs will use any read-only colors in the colormap, so if you
start running X clients that take up these cells, NeWS colors will use
the closest match.  If anyone is interested in using this from NeWS,
send me mail.

The cursor problem is a bug.  Here's a hack to hold you till the
next release.  It should just fail with a (different) error then.


/* hack to fix the black-on-black xnews cursor bug */
/* it'll exit with an error, but don't worry about that */
/* it *is* a hack, after all... */
#include <X11/Xlib.h>
main()
{
    Display    *dpy;		/* X server connection */
    Colormap	cmap;
    XColor	defs[256];
    int	num, i;

    dpy = XOpenDisplay();
    cmap = XDefaultColormap(dpy, 0);
    for (num = 256; num > 10; num--)
	if (XAllocColorCells(dpy, cmap, False, (char *) 0, 0, defs, num))
	    break;
    defs[num].pixel = 255;
    defs[num].red = defs[num].green = defs[num].blue = 0;
    defs[num].flags = DoRed|DoGreen|DoBlue;
    defs[num - 1].pixel = 254;
    defs[num - 1].red = defs[num - 1].green = defs[num - 1].blue = 65535;
    defs[num - 1].flags = DoRed|DoGreen|DoBlue;
    XStoreColors(dpy,cmap,defs,num);
    XSync(dpy, 0);
}
