% Subject: getanimated bug
% 
% There's a bug in getanimated, defined in util.ps. The problem is that
% it's not setting /Exclusivity in the interest to true. Without
% exclusivity, every PostScript process doing a getanimated will receive
% any button clicks, when you're sizing windows, etc. With exclusivity,
% only the most recent process to express interest in such events will
% get them, which is more reasonable behavior. This solves the problem
% with starting several psterms (or whatever) at the same time and
% having them all end up stacked on top of each other. You will be able
% to position one after the other, now. Here is what getanimated should
% look like:

systemdict begin % Make sure it goes into systemdict, if loaded with psh ...
/getanimated {
    10 dict begin
    /proc exch  def /y0 exch def /x0 exch def
    currentcursorlocation /y exch def /x exch def
    GA_constraint null ne GA_value null eq and {
	/GA_value currentcursorlocation GA_constraint 1 eq {exch} if pop store
    } if
    .033333 blockinputqueue
    {   createevent dup begin
	  /Name [PointButton AdjustButton MenuButton] def
	  /Action [UpTransition DownTransition] def
	  /Exclusivity true def
	  end expressinterest
	createevent dup /Name /MouseDragged put expressinterest
	unblockinputqueue
	{   
	    GA_constraint 0 eq {/x GA_value def} if
	    GA_constraint 1 eq {/y GA_value def} if
	    erasepage x0 y0 moveto x y /proc load exec stroke
	    awaitevent begin
	      Action UpTransition eq { end exit } if
	      /x XLocation store /y YLocation store
	    end
	} loop
	erasepage
	/GA_constraint null store
	/GA_value null store
	[x y] 
    } fork
    end
} def

end % systemdict
