% 
% Is anybody else out there using Adobe Illustrator88 to generate Post-
% Script for use in NeWS?  After you save your file (NOT EPS) on the
% MacIntosh, and get to your real computer :-) (we use TOPS, but there
% are other ways), all of Adobe's document definitions tend to make NeWS
% throw up.  Here's the solution we've developed:  strip the header
% and trailer information from the Ill88 file, and prepend the stuff
% you see listed below.
% 
% We haven't yet dealt with everything, notably text and Pantone colors.
% You will also note that, due to differences in the MacII and NeWS
% color maps, your colors won't be quite what you expected.
% 
% If anyone else out there is doing similar stuff, we'd be very
% interested in what you've done.
% 
% Feel free to do to this what you want, but leave the notice attached,
% and please send to us or post here any neat stuff you do with it.

% Illustrator file, and prepend this header.  It doesn't work
% with everything, notably with text, and it assumes the cmyk
