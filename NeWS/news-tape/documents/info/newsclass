Prerequisites:	This course is targeted for both application
		developers who will use high level packages,
		and window system programmers who will build
		the toolkits.

		You are underqualified if: you have no programming
		experience. Some background in using and programming
		other windowing systems is helpful. Basic SunOS
		skills, e.g. listing files and using a text editor 
		are required.
