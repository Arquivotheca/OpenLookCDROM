Subject: SunDew paper, and USENIX Proceedings

A paper by James Gosling about SunDew (now known as NeWS), called
"SunDew: A Distributed and Extensible Window System", appears in the
book "Methodology of Window Management" (ed.  F.R.A. Hopgood,
Springer-Verlag (1985)), which is the proceedings of an Alvey Workshop
held in April of 1985, in Abingdon, UK. It contains papers by Gosling,
Rosenthal, and Teitelman, and others, about several window systems,
including SunDew, SunWindows, Andrew, SmallTalk, Pilot, Cedar,
Saphire, and more.

Owen Densmore's paper, "Object Oriented Programming in NeWS" appears
in the Monterey Graphics Proceedings (Nov. 1986).

Subject: more references to learn PostScript
From: scout%zyzzyva@Sun.COM (David LaVallee)

The point should be made that PostScript is VERY worth learning
regardless of the learning resources you have available. This
message will enumerate a number of the resources I have called
on to teach PostScript language and NeWS. I have the bias of having
been a graphic designer before getting into this computer stuff.

PostScript is found in "many" (understatement intended) printers
at a variety of resolutions and numbers of colors. All of the window
systems of the (near, and past-present) future leverage PostScript in
some fashion.

In the early days of PostScript my development environment consisted
of the Adobe "Blue" book, and cat-ing files to the LaserWriter, counting
the number of times the yellow light blinked to determine how far my
program had got.

The situation is much better today:

The Bible:

	Book:	Adobe Systems Inc.: PostScript Reference
		Addison-Wesley
		the "Red" book

Beginner-Intermediate:

	Book:	D Holzgang, Understanding PostScript Programing
		Sybex
	Book:	Adobe Systems Inc.: PostScript Tutorial and CookBook
		Addison-Wesley
		the "Blue" book
	MacSW:	-LaserTalk, by Emerald City Software
		-the Cricket products
		-Adobe Illustrator
		-Aldus Freehand
		(appologies if I've left out any, it's just that I
		 don't follow Mac software availability too closely)

Advanced

	Book:	Adobe Systems Inc.: PostScript Program Design
		Addison-Wesley
		the "Green" book
		(I can't wait for the cyan, yellow, and magenta books)
	Book:	Bove, Davis, Rhodes: Adobe Illustrator, official handbook
		Bantam Computer Books
		especially chapter 6...
	Paper:	O Densmore: Object Oriented Programming in NeWS
		Nov. 1986, USENIX Monterey Computer Graphics Workshop
	SW:	NeWS on Sun, SGI, Mac, Amiga, VAX, RT, ISI, OS2, etcetera.

Also of interest:

	Book:	Alex White: How to Spec Type
		published by Watson-Guptill, a good introduction to
		Graphic Design with a bent on typography.
	Book:	S Ambron, and K Hooper: Interactive Multimedia
		Microsoft Press
	Book:	G Holzmann: Beyond Photography, the Digital Darkroom
		Prentice Hall
		(more on this one later)

>From article <8809300004.AA02405@zyzzyva.sun.com>, by scout%zyzzyva@SUN.COM (David LaVallee):

Thanks for the references.  But I'd like to disrecommend:

" 	Book:	D Holzgang, Understanding PostScript Programing
" 		Sybex

Not enough examples, mostly repeats material in the Blue book,
condescending tone ("Now we're going to examine the concept of ...").
