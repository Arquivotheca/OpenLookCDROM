Subject: Sun User Group contribution form

We are putting together a collection of NeWS software to contribute to
the Sun Users Group donated software tape. We would like to use your
software on upcoming tape(s).  To do this, we have to get a signed
release from you that authorizes us to have the software and to
reproduce and distribute it.  We apologize for the trouble involved;
we've tried to make this as painless as possible, within the
limitations of the current legal system.

We have enclosed a copy of the software contribution form, which you
can print out, fill in, sign, and mail to us.  A mailing "label" is
also enclosed.  Don't send it back to us by email; we need your real
hardcopy signature.

Our lawyers advise us that if you developed these materials in
connection with your job, or as an independent contractor working on a
job, the materials may be owned by your employer or client.  If this is
the case, or if you are not sure, either clarify the situation or
duplicate the contribution form and have your employer or client fill
out a copy too.  We can't distribute software if we don't know who the
owner is, unless all the possible owners authorize us.

By the way, "owner" is roughly equivalent to "copyright holder" here.

If you developed the materials with other people, please get your
co-authors to sign release forms as well, unless you are authorized
to act for the group.  If your work is based upon the work of others,
please indicate how we can get in touch with them.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact Don
Hopkins at ...!uunet!mimsy!don, don@brillig.umd.edu, or (301)
454-1517, or the Sun Users Group office at ...!sun!users,
users@sun.com, or (415) 336-4343.

Thanks for your patience with this BS.  See you on the tape!
