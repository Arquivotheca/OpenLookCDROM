This is a lisp version of the NeWS client interface tool CPS. It implements
most of the features of CPS. The known limitations are:

  * The following argument types are supported:
       - string
       - int
       - float
  * CPS seems to understand two syntaxes for interface specifications, namely:
	cdef name (args) ps-code => tag(results)
	cdef name (args) => tag(results) ps-code
    Currently, lps understands only the former one.

  * This software has been used only with Allegro Common Lisp 3.0.3 and
    a pseudo scheme by Jonathan Rees. Other Lisp systems  require some
    changes depending on the foreighn language interface.

This lps-package contains two versions: 'clps' for common lisp and 'scmps'
for scheme.

The usage of this system is simple. If you have a definition file 'test.cps'
you must run the interface tool 'clps test' (or scmps test).  You must not
include the '.cps' ending.  After that you have a definition file named
'test_h.l', which must be loaded to your lisp application. To get full
performance, you should compile this file first.

To install this software:

  * check 'Makefile' for pathnames. 'byacc' used in the Makefile
    is a special version of yacc producing some error recovery.
    'bison' and 'yacc' can also be used.

  * type 'make'

  * if no errors type 'make install'
