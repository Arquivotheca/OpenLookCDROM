Subject: A mail popup utility for NeWS
From: siegel@hc.dspo.gov  (josh Siegel)

I am posting this since I have gotten several requests...

This pops up a little bubble on the screen whenever you get new
mail (for those mailaholics)...

you put something similer to:
	<user>,|"<program> <machine> /<user> <socket>"

in your ".forward"

For example, this is my .forward:
	siegel,|"/vc/siegel/games/mail/mail-forward sledge /siegel 2000"

also, put a : "/UserName /<user> def"

in your .NeWSrc or your local user.ps or whatever your individual
postscript initialization files are....

For example, mine contains: "/UserName /siegel def"

Send comments and suggestions back to me..

I like using a C-47A "puff dragon" to go shooting beer cans with.
