Default flags:
    ba bb bs cba cbb cea ceb da dba dbb dea deb ea eb lca rcb pn ia gi

Ways to change flags:

    Put a command line into your PostScript code...

    example:
        <beginning of line>%%= -bs +cea -dba

    Put a command line into a .pspp in your home directory

    example:
        -lba -rba -lca

    Set options when you call program...

    example:
        pspp -rca

To run:

% pspp [options files] < file.in > file.out

Or, run it from vi...

:%!pspp

Or,

% pspp -lba foo.cps +lba foobar.ps

Special NeWS related features...

    lines beginning with cdef are assumed to be cdef calls under NeWS.
    This causes the rest of the file (till the next cdef) to be indented one.

    Lines beginning with "#" or "%" are passed through unmodified.

Note to hackers:
    You may notice how I stuck lots of the keywords together into
    a single lex rule... I am not going to explain this... there is
    a reason for this... don't worry about it for now.  The reason
	doesn't show up in this version.
