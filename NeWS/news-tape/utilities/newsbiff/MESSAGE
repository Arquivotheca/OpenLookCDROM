Subject: NeWS mail notifier
From: eagle!icdoc!Ist!jh@ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU  (Jeremy Huxtable)

Here is (yet) another NeWS mail notifier which shows you when mail
arrives and allows you to read the article.  It was inspired by the
recent posting to this group by Josh Siegel.

When mail arrives you get a little envelope appearing on your screen
which is the icon for a window displaying the offending article.

Documentation consists of the comment at the top of the program.

Suggestions for enhancements will be gratefully received.  Some possible
ones are:

     o Use a TextCanvas type window for reading the mail item.
     o For short messages, pop up a postcard rather than an envelope.
     o For really long messages, pop up a parcel icon.
     o For really short messages, pop up a telegram and change all
       the message into upper case with periods replaced by STOP
       etc.

The subject says it all

I did not do a whole lot other than fix up the calling syntax a tad
and make it a little more sendmail friendly. see the header on newsbiff.c
for more info.
