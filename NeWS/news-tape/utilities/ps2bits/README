This is how the PostScript to rasterfile program works.

Ps2bits is a shell script that starts news_server with a command
line argument, therefore avoids the standard start up; replacing
it with the command line argument itself:

	news_server "
	    /width ${WIDTH} def
	    /height ${HEIGHT} def
	    /depth ${DEPTH} def
	    (ps2bits.ps) (r) file cvx exec
	"

This starts news_server with three parameters managed by the shell
script, then executes the file "ps2bits.ps".  This is a PostScript
file that initializes a canvas of size width X height, and draws the
stdin using this canvas.  It then calls "writecanvas" to stdout.

To use, try building a simple piece of PostScript and using that
as stdin; creating a stdout file.  Then use snapshot to view it in
SunView.
