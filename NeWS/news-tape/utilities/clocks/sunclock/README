				SunClock 


The following is a clock in the shape of the Sun logo, which is based on
the roundclock example in the NeWS Manual.  This program was a joint effort
of Greg McLaughlin and Stuart Marks, and was a 'hit' in the Sun booth at
SIGGRAPH this year.

To make the SunClock: 

	o cps sunclock.cps

	o cc -o sunclock sunclock.c $NEWSHOME/lib/libcps.a
