% notes:
%    Glass is an implementation of a NeWS clock that I wrote to
% experiment with shaped canvases. The clock is shaped like the
% the hands and tick marks thereby allowing you to "see through'
% the face to whatever lies behind. Because of the bug concerning
% stroking a canvas path the face must redraw every time it is
% updated (gross).
%    One note on the use of glass. I would not suggest using the
% -s option (second hand) since the updating chews up lots of time.
% Perhaps a few more pauses would help here but I doubt it.
%    Enjoy!
