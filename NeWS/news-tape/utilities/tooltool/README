Tooltool is an interactive LiteItem code builder. You can
create each type of LiteItem, use images for Labels or Objects,
move the items around on the window and finally dump the
code required to build you example.

The right button on the mouse brings up the main menu.

Creating Items

The Help key brings up a window which describes the format
required by both the Label and Object fields. Be sure your
entries are correct, I have some checking for incorrect
entries but it's not bullet proof.

Object Location sets the Object relative to the Label. This
isn't need for buttons (that's why you don't see it).

The middle button on the mouse drags an item around on the 
window. You can resize the window, the final size will be
used in the code generation.

Be sure you clear the Object and Label fields with a
^u (cntrl-u) before entering text, otherwise you
will append to the end of the current entry.
This needs to be fixed.


Dumping Items

The dump items menu allows you to dump the current code 
to stdio, or dump the code to a file. Dump to a demo
will dump the code required to build a simple LiteWindow
with your LiteItems on it. The file will be named
tooltool0, then tooltool1....

Deleting Items

Use dump to stdio to get the key associated with the item.
The delete menu is dynamically built to list each current item,
just choose the item you wish to delete.

Let me know how you like this demo, and let me know when
it breaks. Have fun.
