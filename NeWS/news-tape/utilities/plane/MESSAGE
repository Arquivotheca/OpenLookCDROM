Subject: Some useful window subclasses
From: dennis!dennis@boulder.colorado.edu

% --------------------------------------------------

% This file contains two major windowing subclasses:
% 1. PlaneWindow - makes it look like the window is a view into
%    a client canvas of large size.  The window can pan and scroll
%    over this larger canvas using scrollbars
% 2. ControlWindow - PlaneWindow plus a message panel
%    plus  a panel for providing input.
