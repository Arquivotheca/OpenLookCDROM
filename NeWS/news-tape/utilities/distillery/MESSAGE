Thanks for all your comments and bug files from the last release of the
Distillery.  Here is the latest release, which I think fixes most of
the bugs reported.  There was one file that I couldn't fix that was
combining user-defined fonts with Times fonts in strange ways to form
Hebrew characters (I think) that still confuses the distillery.  Other
than that, I hope it is pretty robust at this point.  As usual, bug
reports, comments, and encouragement should be sent to greid@adobe.COM

Thanks,
