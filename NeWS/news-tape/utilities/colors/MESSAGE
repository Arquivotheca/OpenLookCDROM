While I'm at it, I figure I might as well post my mono.ps and color.ps
files.  Snazzy, yet tasteful and understated.  I find that they wear well.

If you want to "test-drive" these colors, just
   getcolors >savecolors
   psh stanscolor.ps

If you don't like it:
   psh savecolors

P.S.:  Ignore article's reply address since my poster mungs it; use
signature address instead.

P.P.S.:  While I'm at it I might as well ask if "backgroundcolor" and
"textcolor" are really good ideas or whether (window) class variables like
ClientFillColor and (the hypothetical) ClientTextColor make more
sense.

P.P.P.S.:  Does anyone know any tricks that would let me aim
"setcolor" at a *particular* window.  I suppose I could add another
interest to LiteWindow that is called /Execute and which executes its
/Action.  Then I'd create a framebuffer overlay, make its cursor a
crosshair (neatness counts), wait for a SelectButton event, mutate it
to a /Execute event, stick a procedure to see if we found a window
(gotta be careful!) and change some color attribute in the /Action,
and redistribute the event.  Two questions: 1) is there an easier way?
and 2) Can I do it without modifying the window class?

P.P.P.P.S:  These PP*S's are getting out of hand.

Then type "echo PaintRoot | psh" to make the colors show up.

Alternatively, you can select "Repaint All" from the root menu.

Likewise

It's always something!  I'm sure you understand how it is.
