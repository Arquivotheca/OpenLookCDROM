Subject: NeWS object browser & error handler
From: eagle!icdoc!Ist!jh@ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU  (Jeremy Huxtable)

I keep hearing on the net about various NeWS class browsers but have yet
to see one.  What I do have though, is my own object browser and editor
which I wrote one afternoon to rectify this loss. You may find this useful
if you don't already have something similar.

To go with the object browser, there is an error handler, which pops
up a browser on your process whenever an error occurs.  I, at least,
find this extremely useful.

Notes:  - This is an Object browser, not a Class browser.
	- It was thrown together very quickly in order to answer a need,
	  and probably needs rewriting.
	- I would like to do more work on it, but I am leaving for distant
	  parts in a couple of weeks, and will not be able to do more or
	  answer many questions unless you are quick.
	- It needs lots of clever extensions, new features, etc., provided
	  by anyone who is willing.  I won't be here to receive them though.
	- It is, though, very useful.
