usage: newsmon [-c clientport#] [-s serverport#] [-ttyNN] [-terse]

newsmon moniters traffic between a NeWS client and the NeWS server.
By default it connects to the NeWS server on port #2000 and listens
for a client connection on port #2001.  For most NeWS client applications,
setting the NEWSSERVER environment variable:
	setenv NEWSSERVER '0.2001;hostname'
will force the client to connect to port #2001.  Once the connection is
made, newsmon displays the client/server traffic in the tty window that
it was started in.
