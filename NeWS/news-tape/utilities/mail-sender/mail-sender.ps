% Subject: mail-sender
% To: news-makers@brillig.umd.edu
% 
% After installing newsbiff I was irritated by the fact that I had to
% use mail to reply to messages, so I hacked a small utility called
% mail-sender. It is a small NeWS program which opens up a window with
% two items; a text item where the user can enter an email address and
% a "compose and send" button".
% 
% To send mail you enter an email address into the "To:" field
% (TextItem) and click the "compose and send" button. The program will
% then use forkunix to start "mail" in a psterm window (in which the
% mail is composed and sent).
% 
% This is just a quick hack and no attempt to create a NeWS variant of
% mailtool.  It works well if you have newsbiff installed, except from
% the fact that messages are not removed from the mail queue (newsbiff
% is just a biff program).
% 
% Sometimes the message written seems to just disappear into a black
% hole, I suspect that this is due to some bug in the code for the
% TextItem class (does it include control characters in the ItemValue,
% maybe?)
