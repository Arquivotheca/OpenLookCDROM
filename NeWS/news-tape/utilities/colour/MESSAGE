Subject: Choosing colours utility
From: mcvax!ukc!stl!orkb@uunet.uu.net  (Owen Benson)

	This is a little utility which allows a user to choose a colour
by clicking on a colour-wheel item. It provides both RGB and HSB values
for the chosen colour.
	I have built this using a few objects I have built over the last
10 months. I included these objects in the hope they will make it easier
for others to build applications in NeWS. The most useful object to this
end is the Form item which manages a set of other items. This means you
never again need create a dictionary in userdict, do a forkitems on it
or overwrite PaintClient with {items paintitems ...}!!
	The ColorWindow is an example of how you can create a window
with managed items using the objects provided here.
	Have Fun!

P.S.	I found reading long names all in lower case (e.g. paintclient)
a real pain; instead I use underscore separators between the words
(e.g. paint_client). If you use the Lite items and windows this does
make it difficult to remember which names use which style; I got around
this by building a set of items and windows which are consistent in all
using underscores. Perhaps one day my boss will let me post them...
