Subject: new and improved browser
From: carlisle!bvs@sun.com  (Bruce V. Schwartz / Marketing Technical Support)

This is the new version of the browser that was hidden on the SUG SEX
machine in a miscellaneous/unorganized directory.  So you may not have seen
this even if you got SEX at SUG.

Many changes in November 1988.  Integrated several of Richard Hess's
improvements.  New features include improved scrolling, caching of browsed
classes, addition of the NoClass class for browsing the systemdict, better
decompilation of dictionaries, process control (new request cancels
previous), better error handling, faster sorting,  and looks better on
B/W screen.

The browser is built on the classes defined in pw.ps.  The class
browser has 5 panes.  It is similar in appearance to the Smalltalk
browser.  The first pane on the top of the window contains the list of
classes in the server.  The next 3 contain the list of methods, class
variables, and instance variables associated with the selected class in
the first pane.  The bottom pane is used to display information about
the current selection.
