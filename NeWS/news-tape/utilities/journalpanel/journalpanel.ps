% One little trick for recording; journalling adds a main menu item when it
% is brought up. This will cause a problem when you are recording, since
% this menu item will not be there during playback. Here is a little program
% that will bring up the journalling control panel without having an
% extra menu item installed:

%
%  Bring up the journalling control panel w/o a menu entry
%
   systemdict /Journal known not {(NeWS/journal.ps) run} if
   JournalUI {def} forall       % Include all of JournalUI in our userdict
   startlistener                % Start the journalling process
   createcontrolpanel           % Create our window
   {displaycontrolpanel} journaldoit % Bring up the control panel

% By the way, NeWS1.1 is a shipping product. It is now simply a question of
% how fast your NeWS1.1 order gets processed...
