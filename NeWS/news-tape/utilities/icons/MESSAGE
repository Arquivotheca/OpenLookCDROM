Subject: Re: converting SunView icons to NeWS icons
From: thaeler@hc.dspo.gov  (Bret K. Thaeler)

This is another program that was written when the code that Josh
previously posted was created. This program converts each character
of a vfont into a seperate file in suntools iconedit format.  This
allows you to take the existing NeWS Icon font and convert it into a
vfont, you can then dump that into files sutable for use with the
iconedit tool. You can then take this and with the code previously
posted and put the new modified icon back into your NeWS applications...

Here is how to do it:
	1) First compile the inclosed program.
		a) extract the end of this article into the
		   file 'extract_font.c'.
		b) % cc -o extract_font extract_font.c

	2) Now copy the NeWS Icon font and make it into a vfont.
		a) % mkdir play
		b) % cd play
		c) % cp /usr/NeWS/fonts/Icon12.fb .
		d) % dumpfont -d . -v Icon12.fb

	3) Now run the extract font program.
		a) % extract_font Icon12.vft


The extract font program will produce a file for each character in
the font. Each file will be named 'Icon12.vft.??' where ?? is the
'character number' of the icon. You can now type '% iconedit' and
load the file '*' to lookat and select to modify any of the icons...

If you have any questions or comments let me know.  Have fun.....
