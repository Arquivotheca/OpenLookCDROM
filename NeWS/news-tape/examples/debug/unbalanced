Subject: simple trick for finding unbalanced parens
From: Don Hopkins <don@brillig.umd.edu>

Every once in a while I'll accidentally munge a PS file that I'm
editing, and delete a closing brace or paren or something. The symptom is
that I psh a file, NeWS crunches on it, and then nothing happens.

Inserting the following two lines into the beginning of the file helps
to find out where it is the scanner's getting bonked out:

/old-def /def load def
/def { 1 index = flush old-def } def
