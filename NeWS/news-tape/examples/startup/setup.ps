% In addition to (and complementing) the user.ps/.newsrc approaches that have
% been described to do initial setup in NeWS, you can use the new journalling
% facility in NeWS1.1 to do some of your setup. This approach lets you literally
% do anything you can do with a keyboard and mouse automatically during setup.
% 
% To do this, record a journal script that does what you want to do, then
% have it play back by putting the following at the end of your user.ps:
%
% 			Steve Isaac
% 			Sun Microsystems
% 			sun!sai

% Kick off startup script
{ newprocessgroup
  1 120 div sleep  % Wait for the server to start up (only needed if user.ps
		   % is called before the server is started up)

  % Tell the user when journal playback is complete
  {
     % Create an event that matches the journalling end-of-play event
     createevent dup begin
        /Name /JournalEvent def
        /Action /EndPlay def
     end expressinterest
     % Wait for this event to be generated
     awaitevent
     pop
     currentcursorlocation (Journalling Initialization Complete) popmsg
  } fork pop

  % Tell the user that we are starting journal playback (optional)
  currentcursorlocation (Starting Journalling-Driven Initialization) popmsg
  1 60 div sleep

  % Give the name of our journal playback file to journalling (~/.newsjournal)
  Journal /PlaybackFile (~/.newsjournal) put

  % Start journal playback
  journalplay
} fork pop
