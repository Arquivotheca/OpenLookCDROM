% Below is what we use around here... it gives each user the

%
% NeWS startup code for '.NeWSrc' files in home directory.
%
% This is called from 'init.ps'. This code reads
% commands out of a '.NeWSrc' file in you home directory.
% This allows you to initilize menus and to prestart
% jobs. (like suntools).
%
% Note: This file is superceeded by 'user.ps' files in
% the directory from which the server is started.
% BUT, this file superceeds the presentes of a 'user.ps'
% file in  your home directory.

/dspouserfilelen (HOME) getenv length def
