% I use the journalling facility in NeWS 1.1 to set up my screen.  The
% last thing my user.ps file does is to invoke a journal file called
% "hello".

systemdict /Journal known not { (NeWS/journal.ps) run } if

/playdemo { % playbackfilename => -
  Journal begin
    State /Stopped eq {
      { PlaybackFile
	/PlaybackFile 3 -1 roll def
        newprocessgroup
        framebuffer setcanvas
        journalplay
	/PlaybackFile exch def
      } fork pop
    } if
    pop
  end
} def

(hello) playdemo

% You can journal keystrokes as well as mouse events! But I had to set
% my autorepeat threshold higher to avoid prrrrrrroblems when the
% journal file gets played back more slowly than it was recorded. (It
% journals key down and up events. An option to journal just the
% translated ASCII events would be useful.)

% Set key repeat
UserProfile begin
    /KeyRepeatThresh	1 60 div .8 mul userdefault
    /KeyRepeatTime	1 60 div 10 div userdefault
end

% My "hello" journal file starts a console window, runs a psh in it,
% starts the debugger, iconifies it, and runs several remote terminal
% window and other programs from various menus, set up in my user.ps.

% I go visit the Coke machine while it's warming up.
