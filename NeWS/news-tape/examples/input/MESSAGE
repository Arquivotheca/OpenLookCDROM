Subject: Input example program, NeWS to C
From: scout%zyzzyva@Sun.COM (David LaVallee)

What follows is a shar file that contains a NeWS server program (cn.cps)
and a C program (cn.c). The program cn is an example of getting three
types of common input from the window system into a C client.

	MENU:	C recieves an index token corresponding to the menu choice

	CLICK:	mouse clicks send C their scaled x,y location

	KEYBOARD:	<CR> sends C a string that the user was editing
		in the NeWS window.
