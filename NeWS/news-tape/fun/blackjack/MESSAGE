To: news-makers@brillig.umd.edu


I wrote this blackjack game as more an exercise in NeWS programming
more than a useful game (that's why it is posted here and not in
comp.sources.games). Hopefully you will find the ideas used within
the program useful although the code is relatively horrible.

You are free to do whatever you want to do to this.
