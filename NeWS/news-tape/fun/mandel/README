Mandel is a NeWS demo designed to show how a remote compute server
("number cruncher") can be used for interactive graphics applications.

The Mandelbrot curves are computed in the client program and sent to
the NeWS server as PostScript "lineto" commands. The server stores the
curves as an array of executable procedures. The server can rescale and
display the image from this array without having to ask the client to
recompute.

The best way to demo it is to sit at a color workstation running
NeWS, executing mandel on one or more remote machines using the "on"
command.  I usually start it off on a remote 3/160 and let it run
while I explain how it works.  Then I start another process on a 4/260
and show how the Sun-4 catches up and passes the Sun-3.  Mandel has
also been seen running on Crays and Alliants.
