% From: don@ballast.cs.umd.edu (Don Hopkins)
% 
% If you put the following into your startup.ps file, the root
% background will be repainted brighter gray as the NeWS server gets
% larger, going from black to white (and going back to black) every
% Megabyte.  You get interesting background effects over time, as you
% move windows around, and the server grows.  And you can watch for
% memory leaks by running All Windows=>Bounce=>Icons!
% 
% Enjoy!
