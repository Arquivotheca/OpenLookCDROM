This is psgammon, the NeWS backgammon program.  You also need a modified
version of the UCB backgammon game to run this program.  Psgammon is
copyrighted by Sun Microsystems, Inc. but may be freely distributed.
See the copyright notice at the beginning of each source file for details.

To install psgammon, run make in the psgammon directory and in the
ucbgammon directory and then move the two binaries (psgammon and
backgammon) to a public place.  You may want to change the scorefile
path in score.h (default /usr/local/lib/gammonscores) and the path of
backgammon in defs.h (default is to search the current PATH) before
compiling.  You can also set TARGETDIR (the location in the file system
where psgammon will be installed) and DESTDIR (the root of the file system
into which psgammon will be installed) in the Makefile.  Then "make install"
to install psgammon and the font files.

Psgammon is derived from gammontool, the SunView backgammon program.  The
code has been hacked on twice since then, so it is pretty ugly at
this point.  Please don't use it as a model for writing NeWS programs--
I wrote the PostScript code nearly two years ago while I was learning
NeWS.

Bug reports/fixes are welcome but I can't commit to spending any time
supporting psgammon.  Have fun!
