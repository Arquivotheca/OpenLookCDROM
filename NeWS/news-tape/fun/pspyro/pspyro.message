Subject: psPyro, a user extensible fireworks display screen saver
From: marshall@software.org (Eric Marshall)
Sender: NeWS-makers-request@brillig.umd.edu (Don Hopkins)

	psPyro is a user extensible fireworks display screen
saver.  psPyro is fashioned after the MacIntosh screen saver
program "Pyro", written by Bill Steinberg and Steve Brecher.
Although psPyro actually contains no code which determines if
the screen saver should be invoked, it should be possible to
incorporate psPyro into a "true" screen saver program, e.g. Stan
Switzer's NeWS-based BlankScreen program or some system-level
screen saver.  psPyro executes by randomly selecting a place
to fire each firework, randomly selects a direction in which
to fire the firework, randomly selects a width and height for
the firework trail to follow, and finally, randomly selects a
number of explosions to explode to conclude the firework firing.
This continues forever until either the mouse is moved or one
of the mouse buttons is pressed.

	User extensibility is achieved via definitions in the
/PSPyro dictionary, which is located in /systemdict.  Although
only a small number of psPyro's internal definitions were intended
to be user configurable, all can be modified.  The intended user
modifiable definitions are as follows:

	/unusable_screen_width - the percent of each side of the screen
				 which will not be used to fire a firework
				 from.  The default is 10% of the screen
				 width.

	/unusable_screen_height - the percent of the top of the screen which
				  will not be used by the trail of a firework.
				  The default is 10% of the screen height.

	/minimum_trail_height - the minimum height of a firework trail, in
				terms of a percentage of the screen height.
				The default is 75% of the screen height.

	/minimum_explosion_angle - the minimum angle a firework trail will
				   travel before an explosion occurs.
				   Logically, fireworks travel in a
				   counterclockwise direction, starting at
				   angle 0.  The default is 100.

	/maximum_explosion_angle - the maximum angle a firework trail will
				   travel before an explosion occurs.  The
				   default is 150.

	/minimum_#_explosions - the minimum number of explosions per firework.
				The default is 1.

	/maximum_#_explosions - the maximum number of explosions per firework.
				The default is 5.

	/trail_length - the length (in degrees) of the animated firework trail.
			The default is 3.

	/time_between_firings - the time (in seconds) between firework firings.
				The default is 2.

	/multiple_explosion_radius - the radius (in units) from the center
				     of the original explosion to the center
				     of multiple explosions.  The default
				     is 100.

	/delay_amount - the number of /pause's between firework trail updates.
			The default is 50.  I would have preferred to specify
			a time in seconds to delay for, but /sleep wasn't
			allowing for satisfactory animation.

	/explosion_kinds - the array which contains the names of the procedures
			   implementing the different explosions.

	A standard place to provide user specific definitions
for psPyro is in your user.ps file.  An example user.ps fragment
follows which specifies the values for the minimum and maximum
explosion angles, and which adds a new explosion to the list
of available explosions (default is 5 different explosions):

	systemdict begin
	  /PSPyro 20 dict def

	  PSPyro begin
	    /minimum_explosion_angle 45 def
	    /maximum_explosion_angle 90 def

	    /T { translate 0 0 moveto 1 setgray (Explosion) show } def

	    /explosion_kinds [ /T ] def
	  end
	end

	A few words are in order concerning the definition of
new explosions.  If /explosion_kinds is provided within /PSPyro,
then the contents of the provided array are ADDED to the internal
psPyro list of available explosions.  If /replace_explosion_kinds
is provided, the provided array is used to REPLACE the internal
psPyro list.  Also, each procedure named in the /explosion_kinds
and /replace_explosion_kinds arrays accept two parameters, the
x and y position of the center of the explosion.  The supplied
explosion procedures simply /translate to the specified location
and draw about the origin, but more sophisticated procedures
could use the positional information as the basis for altering
the explosion shape, e.g. if the explosion is to occur very high
or very low.  Go ahead and write some fancy explosions.  Collect
them, trade them, sell them :-)

	Unfortunately, I don't have access to a color monitor,
so there is no support for color anything.  Wouldn't it be nice
if someone with a color monitor ...

	psPyro was developed on a Sun 3/160 running NeWS 1.1
under SunOS 3.5.
