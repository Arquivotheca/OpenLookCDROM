	Paper is a heavily modified version of psview from
Sun Microsystems, Inc.  The original code is freely distributable
and the modifications (made at the Grasshopper Group) are in
the public domain.

To install paper, make a directory for it, snip off the header
>from the shar file, and unpack it using sh.  Then, type make.
Typeing 'make install' will copy the binary to /usr/NeWS/bin
and install the PostScript code in /usr/NeWS/lib.

To use paper without installing the PostScript code in /usr/NeWS/lib,
just put paper.ps in your home directory, or psh it before running
paper.
