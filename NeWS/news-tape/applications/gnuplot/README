GNUPLOT has been tested on a Pyramid 90x (ucb 4.2 and att V), a VAX 8200
(VMS 4.3), IBM PC's and AT's (MS-DOS 3.1, Microsoft C 4.0).  The code is
written with portability in mind, and it passes lint!  If you have
problems, send mail to vu-vlsi!plot.  And please send any modifications
you make so they can be #ifdef'd into later releases. 


                      GNUPLOT 1.1 RELEASE NOTES

New terminal drivers:  AED 512, BBN BitGraph, HP2623, POSTSCRIPT, Selanar,
Vectrix 384.  The PC version now supports Hercules and ATT 6300 monochrome
graphics.  Thanks to those who sent these drivers in.

New commands:  'set dummy' and 'show dummy' to select the dummy variable
name; 'replot' to repeat the last 'plot' command.

The exclamation point (!) is now accepted as postfix factorial operator.
The gamma() function is also included, if your C library has gamma().  See
GAMMA below.

Logical AND (&&) and OR (||) now short-circuit the way they do in C.  That
is, the second && operand is not evaluated if the first is false; the
second || operand is not evaluated if the first is true.  The ternary operator
(?:) also does not evaluate the unused operand.  This change allows for the
definition of recursive functions, e.g. a synonym for the ! factorial operator:

	fact(x) = (x<=1) ? 1 : x*fact(x-1)

GNUPLOT now has a much better memory allocation scheme, replacing
most fixed-size arrays with malloc()'d linked lists.  There is no longer
any artificial maximum on the number of simultaneous plots, number of
points in those plots, or the number of user-defined functions or
variables.  All these are limited only by the memory available to
malloc().  This is a big improvement for memory-starved machines like
PDP-11s or PCs.

Lines beginning with # (also ! in VMS) are treated as comments.  Only the
$ may now be used for a shell escape in VMS, since ! is a comment.

The PC version now has the 'help' command, thanks to code posted by
Robert Scott.

Several old bugs have been superseded by new ones.

                             TO COMPILE

under UNIX:  type 'make'

under VMS:  type '@compile', then '@link'.  Use the 'vmshelp.csh' script
(in the docs subdirectory) to convert the help files.  If you don't have
access to a Unix machine, send us mail and we'll send you the VMS GNUPLOT.HLB.

under MSDOS:  use 'make make.msc' for Microsoft C 4.0.  If you've got
another compiler, you're on your own!  For MSDOS help, use the 'vmshelp.csh'
script to create the file 'gnuplot.hlp', then download this to your PC.  Run
'BUILDHLP . < GNUPLOT.HLP' to create the help tree.


                         ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

If the environment variable GNUTERM is found, it is used as the terminal
type.

If the environment variable GNUHELP exists, it is used as the command to
spawn for help.

The PC version looks for then environment variable GNUPLOT to contain
the name of the directory from which to load the initialization file
GNUPLOT.INI.  See the help on 'start_up' for more information.

			NeWS DRIVER   

The support of the NeWS Window System Version 1.1 has been added to Gnuplot.
If you are running the NeWS window system, you can send the output to a
separate graphics window by setting term to news.  

There is an added option: "set pause on" to allow for pausing between
multiple frames.  By setting output to a file name you can save the output
as postscript at the same time you are plotting under NeWS.  By setting
output to print, you can have the output sent through a pipe to a PostScript
laser printer while you are looking at it on NeWS. The GNUPRINT environment
variable controls the printer command. Alternatively, you can print from the
window itself using the window menu.  This option saves the print file into
lpr.ps in the startup directory of NeWS as well as printing it with the lpr
-m command.  To change the default printer change this entry in the term.cps
file.  The window menu also allows one to zoom in on the window and print
that enlarged region.  It also allows multiple display windows, each of
which can be selected as the active display window.  Different plots can
also be overlayed even in the zoomed state.
