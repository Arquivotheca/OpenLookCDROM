	Change is an operator to replace text.  It takes the scope
	of its "changing" from a following motion command.  
	For instance, 'ce' sets up to change text up to the end
	of the current word.  

	Changing text is done in "insert" state.  Here are some
	examples of command sequences to change text:

	  ce	change to end of word
	  c$	change to end of line
	  c/pat	change to first occurence of pat
	  c)	change to end of sentence
