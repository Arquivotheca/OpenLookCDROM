Subject: Enhanced psview and DVI previewing (Part 1 of 2)
To: news-makers@brillig.umd.edu

I've decided to post my psview enhancements (enlargement/reduction,
scrollbars, European paper sizes, box mode), and my DVILASER/PS previewing
code. If you only want the psview enhancements, you only need the Part 1.

	Have fun,
		Angus
