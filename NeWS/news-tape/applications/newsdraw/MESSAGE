I'm about to post NewsDraw, a graphical object editor
that runs under NeWS.

NewsDraw consists of about 500 lines of NeWS and about 2000 lines of C.
NewsDraw is intended as a demonstration of the proper way to spit a NeWS
application into client and server sections.  NewsDraw also demonstrates
how the PostScript imaging model allows text and graphics to be treated
with equal ease.

Enjoy!
