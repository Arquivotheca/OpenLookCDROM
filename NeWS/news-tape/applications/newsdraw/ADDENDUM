Subject: NewsDraw addendum
From: carlisle!bvs@sun.com  (Bruce Schwartz)

People running SunOS 3.x have been having trouble making NewsDraw.
NewsDraw was written under SunOS 4.0.  The major problem is that
the sincos call is new in 4.0.

You can solve the problem by putting the following line at the top of item.c:
	#define sincos(x,s,c) { *s = sin(x); *c = cos(x); }

>From the 4.0 man pages:

    #include <math.h>

     double sin(x)
     double x;

     double cos(x)
     double x;

     void sincos(x, s, c)
     double x, *s, *c;

     Note  that sincos(x,s,c) allows simultaneous computation of *s = sin(x)
     and *c = cos(x).


Happy hacking,
Bruce Schwartz
