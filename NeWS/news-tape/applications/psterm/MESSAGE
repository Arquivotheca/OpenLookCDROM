Subject: Terminal emulator for NeWS window system
To: news-makers@brillig.umd.edu

[  I have been asked, as part of the posting for "psterm" in the Usenet
   newsgroup comp.sources.unix to post this announcement here.   My
   apologies to John Gilmore and company for losing some of their exact
   wording.  -rich $alz  ]

The Grasshopper Group took Sun's psterm and worked it over to make a
much better terminal emulator for NeWS.  We also worked with Sun to
clarify the copyright to make it clear that it can be redistributed by
anyone on any machine.  This package has been posted to the Usenet
newsgroup comp.sources.unix, which is available as the mailing list
unix-sources@brl.mil (contact unix-sources-request@brl.mil).  This
note is being posted as a followup-to the source posting; vnews users
can use "p" to get to the code.

This psterm has:
        scroll bars
        whole screen font changes and variable width fonts
        whole screen point size changes
        resizing can change rows/cols *or* point size
        rectangular and "hot" selections
        numerous bug fixes (more will be needed)

The Grasshopper Group modifications to psterm are by Eric Messick, from
designs by ||ugh Daniel & Eric Messick.  The installation has been
tested on SunOS4.0 on Sparc and 68020 and A/UX on the Machintosh-II.

We encourage you to use and improve it; send us back the changes.  Send
flowers, brickbats, picture postcards and diff files to: tech@toad.com
or to Grasshopper Group, 212 Clayton St., San Francisco, CA  94117.
