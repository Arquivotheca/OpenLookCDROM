This is ched, a cheap WYSIWYG editor.  It was written to
demonstrate some techniques that can be used to gain
performance when writing NeWS applications.

The scrollbar pops up when the mouse slides off to the
left.  left button scrolls up, right button scrolls
down, middle button thumbs.

In test, the left mouse button makes a selection.  It's
like the mac: down, sweep, up.  The middle mouse button
extends the selection.  The right mouse button pops up a
menu.

Typed text replaces the selection.

Keyboard commands:

^F	Move the cursor forward one character
^B	Move the cursor back one character
^D	Delete the character after the cursor
backspace or rubout
	Delete the character preceeding the cursor
^A	Move the cursor to the beginning of the document
^E	Move the cursro to the end of the document
^C	Terminate ched

There are many commands missing, like writing out
files.  These are left as exercises to interested
readers.  Also, there is a fair amount of code to
support interesting formatting, like italic & boldface.
This isn't complete.   (yet)
