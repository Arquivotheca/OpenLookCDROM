    A NeWS based version of MicroEMACS is available via anonymous
ftp from ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu, in the directory Sun3/ue/NeWS.  It
requires NeWS v1.1, and has been tested on Suns and on a Cray 2
(Unicos).
    It is designed to reduce the interrupt load on the host, and does so
to the level of a line editor.  This is important in situations where
the host, such as a Cray, is inefficient at such things.  Using it
on a Cray requires that the necessary parts of the NeWS client side
library be ported.  If anyone needs this I can put it on the ftp
server as well, but my port was minimal (no guarantees for other
applications).
    This is a preliminary version which is made available to get some
feedback.  Some things that will probably change are:
	1) The mouse behaviour is inconsistent with Sun conventions.
	2) The entire front end source is downloaded to the server
	   every time the editor is invoked.  It should check to see
	   if it is locally available before doing so.
	3) Not quite flashy enough to entice nontechnical users.
Suggestions and modifications are welcome.
