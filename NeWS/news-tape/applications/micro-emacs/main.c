 *	- fixed bug in new display routine to wrap cursor on extended
 *	  lines at the right time
 *	- modified the buffer-position command to give reasonable info

 *	  !inword().
 *	[Released version 3.6g to Krannert]
 *	10-may-86
 *	- Added IBMPC.C an IBM-PC specific display driver. This makes paging
 *	  4-6 times faster. Also made some conditional changes to DISPLAY.C

 *	  specified argument
 *	- improved help's logic not to re-read the file if it was already
 *	  in a buffer
 *	- added MAGIC mode to all structures and command tables, but the
 *	  regular expression code that John Gamble is writing is not ready.
 *	18-may-86
 *	- added interactive prompt requests in command line execution (i.e.
 *	  while executing a macro, a parameter starting with an at sign (@)
 *	  causes emacs to prompt with the rest of the parameter and return
 *	  the resulting input as the value of the parameter).
 *	- added arguments to split-current-window to force the cursor into
 *	  the upper or lower window.
 *	20-may-86
 *	- added support for the Microsoft C compiler as per the changes

 *	12-jun-86
 *	- added count-words (M-^C) command to count the words/chars and
 *	  lines in a region
 *	- changed regions so they could be larger than 65535 (short ->
 *	  long in the REGION structure)
 *	- changed ldelete() and all callers to use a long size. The kill
 *	  buffer will still have a problem >65535 that can not be solved
 *	  until I restructure it.
 *	- grouped paragraph commands and word count together under symbol
 *	  WORDPRO to allow them to be conditionally made (or not)
 *	13-jun-86
 *	- re-wrote kill buffer routines again. Now they support an unlimited
 *	  size kill buffer, and are (in theory) faster.
 *	- changed delete-next-word (M-D) to not eat the newline after a word,
 *	  instead it checks and eats a newline at the cursor.

 *	  window from the top/bottom
 *	- added support for the Data General 10 MSDOS machine
 *	- added save-window (unbound) and restore-window (unbound) commands

 *	  is current, and restore-window returns the cursor to that window.
 *	20-jun-86
 *	- fixed a bug with the fence matching locking up near the beginning
 *	  of a buffer
 *	- added argument to update to selectively force a complete update
 *	- added update-screen (unbound) command so macros can force a
 *	  screen update
 *	21-jun-86
 *	- rearranged token() and nxtarg() calls so that command names and
 *	  repeat counts could also be prompted and fetched from buffers
 *	  [this broke later with the exec re-write....]
 *	- added write-message (unbound) command to write out a message
 *	  on the message line (for macros)
 *	- changed ifdef's so that color modes are recognized as legal in
 *	  b/w version, and simply do nothing (allowing us to use the same
 *	  script files)
 *	[Released version 3.7 on July 1 to the net and elswhere]
 *	2-jul-86
 *	- Changed search string terminator to always be the meta character
 *	  even if it is rebound.
 *	3-jul-86
 *	- removed extra calls to set color in startup code. This caused the
 *	  original current window to always be the global colors.
 *	7-jul-86
 *	- Fixed bugs in mlreplyt() to work properly with all terminators
 *	  including control and spec characters
 *	22-jul-86

 *	  can be respoded to correctly (especially on the HP150)
 *	- changed version number to 3.7e
 *	31-jul-86
 *	- added label-function-key (unbound) command under symbol FLABEL

 *	  with no newline (it no longer throws the partial line out)
 *	- [as suggested by Dave Tweten] Made adding a ^Z to the end
 *	  of an output file under MSDOS configurable under the
 *	  CTRL-Z symbol in ESTRUCT.H
 *	- [Dave Tweten] Spawn will look up the "TMP" environment variable

 *		%<var>		get user variable <var>
 *		$<evar>		get environment variable <evar>
 *		&<func>		evaluate function <func>
 *
 *	- allowed repeat counts to be any of the above
 *	- added code to allow insert-string (unbound) to use its
 *	  repeat count properly

 *	- changed terminal calls to macro's (to prepare for the new
 *	  terminal drivers)
 *	15-dec-86
 *	- changed previous-line (^P) and next-line (^N) to return a
 *	  FALSE at the end or beginning of the file so repeated
 *	  macros involving them terminate properly!

 *	  control the frequency of saving and count until next save
 *	- added &and and &or as functions for logical anding and oring
 *	- added string length &LEN, upper and lower case string funtions
 *	  &LOWER and &UPPER
 *	27-feb-87
 *	- added $lastkey   last keystroke struck and
 *	        $curchar    character under cursor
 *	28-feb-87
 *	- added code for trim-line (^X^T) command and table entries
 *	  for the entab-line (^X^E) and detab-line (^X^D) commands.
 *	  These are conditional on AEDIT (Advanced editing) in estruct.h
 *	18-mar-87
 *	- finished above three commands
 *	- added $version environment variable to return the current
 *	  MicroEMACS version number
 *	- added $discmd emvironment variable. This is a logical flag that
 *	  indicates if emacs should be echoing commands on the command line.
 *	  real useful in order to stop flashing macros and .rc files
 *	- added $progname environment variable. this always returns the
 *	  string "MicroEMACS". OEM's should change this so that macros can
 *	  tell if they are running on an unmodified emacs or not.
 *	- fixed a minor bug in the CGA/MONO detection routine in IBMPC.C
 *	20-mar-87
 *	- integrated EGAPC.C into IBMPC.C and eliminated the file. Now an
 *	  EGA user can switch from EGA to CGA modes at will
 *	- A LOT of little fixes and corrections sent in by John Ruply
 *	25-mar-87
 *	- Fixed buffer variables so they will work when referencing the
 *	  current buffer
 *	26-mar-87
 *	- Fixed atoi() to be more reasonable. trailing whitespace ignored,
 *	  only one leading sign, no non-digits allowed after the sign.
 *	- fixed buffer variables to go from the point to the end of
 *	  line.
 *	28-mar-87
 *	- fixed bugs with 8 bit chars as submited by Jari Salminen
 *	- replace AZTEC/MSDOS agetc() with a1getc() which won't strip
 *	  the high order bit
 *	30-mar-87
 *	- changed list-buffers (^X^B) so that with any argument, it will
 *	  also list the normally invisable buffers
 *	- added store-procedure and execute-procedure/run (M-^E)
 *	  commands to store and execute named procedures.
 *	31-mar-87
 *	- Fixed infinite loop in ^X-X command (when [LIST] is the
 *	  only buffer left) as pointed out by John Maline
 *	- made filenames in getfile() always lower case as pointed
 *	  out by John Maline
 *	2-apr-87
 *	- Fixed buffer variables so they would work on non-current displayed
 *	  buffers. They should now work with ALL buffers....
 *	3-apr-87
 *	- Yanked AZTEC profiling code....not very useful
 *	- Modified IBMPC driver so it will not start in EGA mode
 *	- allow the next-buffer (^X-X) command to have a preceding
 *	  non-negative argument.
 *	14-apr-87
 *	- added John Gamble's modified search.c. The code has cut apx
 *	  200-300 bytes off the executable.
 *	- added the &RND function to generate a random integer between
 *	  1 and its arguments value. Also $SEED is availible as the
 *	  random number seed.
 *	- changed the -k command line switch so if there is no argument,
 *	  it will prompt for one when the file is read
 *	15-apr-87
 *	- added 20 bytes of buffer in getval()'s local argument alloc so
 *	  when it returns a value, it has enough stack space to do at least
 *	  one strcpy() before stomping on the returned value. ALWAYS call
 *	  getval() ONLY from within a strcpy() call.
 *	- made $curcol return a 1 based value instead of a zero based one.
 *	  [changed this back later for 3.8o   it was simply wrong.....]
 *	16-apr-87
 *	- re-wrote strncpy() for AZTEC & MSDOS so it null terminates the
 *	  string.
 *	- changed pipe() to pipecmd() to avoid conflicts with various
 *	  UNIX systems
 *	24-apr-87
 *	- changed open parameters on AMIGA window open to 0/0/640/200
 *	[Froze and released v3.8i via BBS net]
 *	14-may-87
 *	- added nop (M-FNC) that gets called on every command loop
 *	- added $wline, returns and sets # lines in current window
 *	- added $cwline, returns and set current line within window
 *	- added $target, returns/sets target for line moves
 *	- added $search, returns/sets default search string
 *	- added $replace, returns/sets default replace string
 *	- added $match, returns last matched string in magic search
 *	29-may-87
 *	- rewrote word deletes to not kill trailing non-whitespace after
 *	  the last word. Also a zero argument will cause it to just delete
 *	  the word and nothing else.
 *	- more fixes for the search pattern environment variables
 *	30-may-87
 *	- forced all windows to redraw on a width change
 *	2-jun-87
 *	- forced clear-message-line to overide $discmd
 *	- added mlforce() routine and call it in clear-message-line,
 *	  write-message and when $debug is TRUE
 *	- recoded the startup sequence in main()....Much Better...
 *	4-jun-87
 *	- forced interactive arguments ( @"question" ) to ALWAYS be echoed
 *	  regardless of the setting of $discmd.
 *	7-jun-87
 *	- started adding support for Turbo C under MSDOS
 *	11-jun-87
 *	- words now include ONLY upper/lower case alphas and digits
 *	- fixed some more bugs with the startup..(ORed in the global modes)
 *	- took more limits off the self-insert list....
 *	16-jun-87
 *	- macro debugging now displays the name of the current macro.
 *	- fixed a problem in expandp() in search.c that kept high-byte
 *	  characters from working in search strings
 *	18-jun-87
 *	- added &sindex <str1> <str2> function which searches for string 2
 *	  within string 1
 *	[released verion 3.8o internally]
 *	19-jun-87
 *	- added $cmode and $gmode to return and set the mode of the
 *	  current buffer and the global mode
 *	- separated findvar() out from setvar() so it could be used in
 *	  the !LOOP directive (which got canned....read on)
 *	- %No such variable message now types the name of the offending
 *	  variable
 *	22-jun-87
 *	- fixed startup bug when editing the startup file
 *	- added the !LOOP <var> <label> directive
 *	26-jun-87
 *	- dumped !LOOP......added !WHILE. This needed and caused a vaste
 *	  reorginization in exec.c which mainly involved moving all the
 *	  directive handling from docmd() to dobuf(), in the process
 *	  getting rid of a lot of junk and making the result smaller
 *	  than it started.....(yea!)
 *	- added $tpause to control the fence flashing time in CMODE.
 *	  The value is machine dependant, but you can multiply the
 *	  original in macros to stay machine independant. (as
 *	  suggested by Baron O.A. Grey)
 *	- added hook to execute M-FNR (null) during a file read, after
 *	  the name is set and right before the file is read. Took out
 *	  any auto-CMODE code, as this is now handled with a macro.
 *	  (also suggested by Baron O.A. Grey)
 *	- Added Baron O.A. Grey's SYSTEM V typeahead() code...I hope
 *	  this works....if you check this out, drop me a line.
 *	- Added new variable $pending, returns a logical telling if
 *	  a typed ahead character is pending.
 *	29-jun-87
 *	- Made adjustmode() use curbp-> instead of curwp->w_bufp-> which
 *	  fixed some bugs in the startup routines.
 *	- added $lwidth to return the length of the current line
 *	2-jul-87
 *	- Added &env <str> which returns the value of the environment
 *	  variable <str> where possible
 *	- Fixed a NASTY bug in execbuf()..the buffer for the name
 *	  of the buffer to execute was NBUFN long, and got overflowed
 *	  with a long interactive argument.
 *	3-jul-87
 *	- Moved the loop to match a key against its binding out of execute()
 *	  to getbind() so it could be used later elsewhere.
 *	- Added &bind <keyname> which returns the function bound to the
 *	  named key
 *	- changed execute-file to look in the executable path first...
 *	6-jul-87
 *	- changed $curchar to return a newline at the end of a line and
 *	  it no longer advances the cursor
 *	- a lot of minor changes sent by various people....
 *	7-jul-87
 *	- some amiga specific fixes as suggested by Kenn Barry
 *	- added $line [read/write] that contains the current line in the
 *	  current buffer
 *	- changed $curcol so setting it beyond the end of the line will
 *	  move the cursor to the end of the line and then fail.
 *	10-jul-87
 *	- added a number of fixes and optimizations along with the rest
 *	  of the TURBO-C support as submited by John Maline
 *	13-jun-87
 *	- caused dobuf() to copy lastflag to thisflag so the first
 *	  command executed will inherit the lastflag from the command
 *	  before the execute-buffer command. (needed this for smooth
 *	  scrolling to work)
 *	- made flook() look first in the $HOME directory, then in the
 *	  current directory, then down the $PATH, and then in the
 *	  list in epath.h
 *	14-jul-87
 *	- added some fixes for VMS along with support for the SMG
 *	  screen package as submited by Curtis Smith
 *	15-jul-87
 *	- fixed M-^H (delete-previous-word) so it can delete the first
 *	  word in a file....I think there may be more of this kind of thing
 *	  to fix.
 *	16-jul-87
 *	- added code to allow arbitrary sized lines to be read from files..
 *	  speed up file reading in the process.
 *	- made out of memory conditions safer.. especial on file reads
 *	- fixed a bug in bind having to do with uppercasing function
 *	  key names (submitted by Jari Salminen)
 *	- made ST520 exit in the same resolution that EMACS was started in
 *	  (for the 1040ST)
 *	[FROZE development and released version 3.9 to USENET]
