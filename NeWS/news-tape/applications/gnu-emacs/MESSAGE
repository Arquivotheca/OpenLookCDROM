Subject: NeWS support for Emacs 18.52 available
From: Chris Maio <chris@columbia.edu>

A NeWS interface for GNU Emacs 18.52 is now available on columbia.edu in
pub/ps-emacs.tar.Z, or via mail.  This release is compatible with Emacs
versions 18.49 through 18.52, and NeWS versions 1.0 and 1.1.  No new
functionality has been introduced over that offfered by previous versions, but
all known bugs and compatibility problems have been addressed.

Included in the patch kit is major mode for editing PostScript code which
PostScript programmers may find useful in and of itself.

The Internet name servers are still advertising an obsolete address for
columbia.edu, so if you have trouble connecting the ftp server, try specifying
an alternate address (128.59.16.1 or 128.121.13.2).

To get the NeWS interface kit via mail, send a message containing the line
"send NeWS emacs-support" to archive-server@columbia.edu.  The shar file that
will be returned is approximately 75k bytes long.

Chris
