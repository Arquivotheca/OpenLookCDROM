This is V2.2.1 of a desktop calculator for the Sun workstation.
This version works under SunView and NeWS.

This is a complete rehash from the v1.x series, and now includes
many more mathematical and trigonometrical functions. Memory register
manipulation has been extended, the user interface tidied up and color
is now supported.

See the online help or the manual pages for more details.

Thankyou to everybody who has sent me mail suggesting enhancements.

Thanks to Ed Falk at Sun Microsystems (Mountain View) for some of the
basic algorithms used.

Suggestions for furthur improvement would be most welcome plus bugs,
comments and flames.
