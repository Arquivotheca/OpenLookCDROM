<BODY><H1>NeWS: A Thing of Beauty that failed to thrive</H1><H2>What is it?</H2><P>NeWS is Sun's Network Extensible Window System.
It was based on Sun's implementation of PostScript (<EM>not</EM>
Adobe's Display PostScript, which was used in Solaris 2.3 and later),
with numerous extentions for use as an extensible window system.
<H2>History, or Why Did it Fail?</H2><P>
It was invented at around the same time as X10, but was not released
in source code form and only ran on Sun platforms, so the result
was inevitable -- the technically far-inferior X10 and later X11 took over.
</P><H2>TnT, HyperLook, etc</H2><P>
There were several toolkits. TnT, The NeWS Toolkit, was from Sun,
and accompanied by a program called CPS, which translated pseudo-PostScript
into C.
</P>
<P>HyperLook, from The Turing Institute, was an alternative runtime
environment and toolkit.
