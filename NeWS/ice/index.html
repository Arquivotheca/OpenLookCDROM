<H1>ice - image composition environment</H1>
<P>
The following is extracted from the man page:
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>
<PRE>
ice [ -display display ] [ -w width ] [ -h height ] [ -dpi
resolution ] [ ice_file ] [ -H ] [ -ps < ps_file ]
</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<P>ice allows collections of PostScript and raster images  to
be composed into a merged image which may be both interac-
tively previewed and saved to a file. The program operates
under  the  Sun  X11/NeWS  window system on both color and
monochrome displays. (Monochrome displays will  of  course
result in some limitations in functionality, but may still
be quite useful in many instances.)
<H2>Note</H2>
<P>Reliance on features of both the X11 and NeWS window  sys-
tems  cause  this program to be not easily portable to any
window system other than Sun's OpenWindows V2.
<H2>For more details</H2>
