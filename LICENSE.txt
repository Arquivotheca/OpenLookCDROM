There are far too many sources for the files in this repo to give a single answer on licensing.

The O'Reilly books are freely available for download at https://www.oreilly.com/openbook/openlook/,
so you can use them and copy them without charge as long as you give credit for them.

The one book from Sun was widely circulated by Sun themselves, so presumably
the same applies: give them credit.

The source code? Each program has its own license terms. For some of them you
might have to track down the original author if you need to use it for anything
commercial. Good luck.
