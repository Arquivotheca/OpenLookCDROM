<H1>SoftQuad Inc.</H1>
<P>SoftQuad develops electronic publishing software.
Today they are best known for their HoTMetaL and
HoTMetaL PRO HTML editors for the Web, but they
also produce a variety of other software.
<P>Their first large X application, Author/Editor, 
was available in an XView version.
Like HoTMetaL, A/E features a rules file which tells
it what elements are allowed where, so it 
<A HREF="insert.gif">guides you
to insert valid elements</A>.
It has a number of features for larger documents,
including a <A HREF="context.gif">Context View window<A> (this picture
also shows how styles for each element can be adjusted,
rather like HTML3 Styles Files).
