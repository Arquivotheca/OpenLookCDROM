<P>Here is a neat graphics technology. Unfortunately,
the XView version of XRT/graph is no longer maintained, and Motif is now
the standard X Windows development toolkit. However, you can probably
still beg or buy the XView version.
<P> Here is an XRT/graph for XView demo, a graphical front-end
to the <I>vmstat</I> program that dynamically shows the status of your computer.
Quite a bit flashier that <I>perfmeter</I>, eh?
<P><A HREF="trial.sh">Try vmgraph demo (Sun only)</A>. Do check the
About... boxes.
