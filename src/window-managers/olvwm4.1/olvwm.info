:VDM:
Virtual Desktop Manager

The Virtual Desktop Manager (VDM) allows you to
have 1 or more logical desktops one of which may
be viewed at any time.  Each desktop is
represented by a region surrounded with
a dashed line.

The background of the VDM represents the logical
desktops which you currently have; you can
increase or reduce this number simply by
resizing the VDM.  If you make the VDM smaller, 
the rightmost and bottommost desktops will
"go away" and you will not be able to access
any windows in that desktop.  The windows
themselves are still active, though, and will
appear if you again make the VDM larger.

The desktop boundaries are not physical
boundaries; a window can straddle a boundary
and you can view portions of more that one
desktop at a time (whatever amount that will
fit on your screen).  Usually, though, you
will see a logical boundary between desktops.

To move to another desktop, you can use the arrow
keys or you can double-click the SELECT button
inside the VDM at the location you want to go to.
Pressing MENU in the VDM brings up a menu which
also allows you to move to a different desktop.

The small windows in the desktop represent each
frame as it appears on your screen.  In terms of
window manager actions, they mimic the frame they
represent:  you can select and move them with
the SELECT button, you can bring up their
window menu with the MENU button, you can drop
items from other tools into them, etc.  All
actions performed on one of these little
windows affects the frame the window represents.
