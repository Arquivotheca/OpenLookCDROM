    This a list of some problems you can encounter while compiling or
using ctwm.


    1 - You have the message when compiling (static libraries) or
	running (dynamic libraries) ctwm :

ld.so: Undefined symbol: __XtInherit

Why : You have a Sun and the mit X11R5 Xlib prior to the patch level 9,
      there is an incompatibility between the Sun loader and the mit X11R5
      libs before patch 9.

What to do : Upgrade you libs to at least patch level 9, or use :
	     -u __XtInherit at link time.


    2 - On SGI boxes, many GL applications don't behave very well with ctwm.
	If an Xpert having a SGI Xserver can have a look at this, I will be
	very pleased.

What to do : Avoid carefully GL tools.


    3 - Xwd files created on DEC/Alpha may not be loaded correctly by ctwm.
	Actually the xwd format is not completely portable. But you can load
	on an Alpha a xwd file created on another system.

    4 - On some systems (SVR4 I think), sometimes ctwm exits with no warning
	(sometimes, it write 'Alarm Clock'). It is due to a problem with
	signal handling on these systems. If it happens to you, set
	AnimationSpeed to zero, or much better, you can try to find what
	it the problem and send me a patch.
