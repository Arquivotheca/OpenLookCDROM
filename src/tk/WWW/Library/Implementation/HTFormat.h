/*                                            HTFormat: The format manager in the WWW Library
                            MANAGE DIFFERENT DOCUMENT FORMATS
                                             
   Here we describe the functions of the HTFormat module which handles conversion between
   different data representations.  (In MIME parlance, a representation is known as a
   content-type. In WWW  the term "format" is often used as it is shorter).
   
   This module is implemented by HTFormat.c . This hypertext document is used to generate
   the HTFormat.h include file.  Part of the WWW library .
