Differences between FaxTool 1.2 and FaxTool 1.1
-----------------------------------------------

	Modified Makefile to add "debug" target.

	Added support for FAXSERVER environment variable.  Fax Host
	field on Properties popup now defaults to the value of
	FAXSERVER.  Send button processing now sets the sendfax -h
	option to the value stored in Fax Host.

	Fixed bug - Special characters not escaped before calling faxcover.

	Fixed bug - Clear button does not reactivate "Add To Directory"
	button.

	Fixed bug - "Add To Directory" button does not set textfields
	on directory popup.

	Fixed bug - Adding duplicate Fax Directory entry caused core
	dump the next time the scrolling list was selected.

E 3
Differences between FaxTool 1.1 and FaxTool 1.0
-----------------------------------------------

	Added a Fax Directory popup for maintaining and selecting
	Names and Fax Numbers.

	Added a Properties popup for specifing Fax Host, Spool
	Directory, and filters for Viewing, Printing, and Previewing faxes.

	Added fax id (filename) to Receive Queue display.

	Added capability to View, Print and Delete received faxes.

	All panels with scrolling lists are now resizeable and the
	scrolling lists expand/contract accordingly.  Similarly,
	FaxTool now lays out properly when invoked using the -scale
	Xview command line option.

	It is no longer necessary to have DevGuide installed in order
	to build FaxTool.  The distribution now includes the necessary
	DevGuide include files and libraries, as permitted by the
	DevGuide license agreement (NOTE, however, that these files
	cannot be redistributed except as a part of the complete
	FaxTool source distribution).  The Makefile has been modified
	accordingly to look for the environment variable GUIDEHOME, and
	if it is defined, to build FaxTool using DevGuide.  Otherwise,
	it uses the files in ./include and ./lib.  Note, however, that
	these libraries probably will not work unless you are running
	OpenWindows V3.0.


E 2
Requirements:
------------

	SunOS 4.1.x
	Openwindows 3.0
D 2
	DevGuide 3.0
E 2
I 2
	DevGuide 3.0 (optional)
E 2
	An ANSI C Compiler
	FlexFax
	Ghostscript (for Previewing)

	I have successfully built and run this application on a
	SPARCstation 2 using:

		SunOS 4.1.3
		Openwindows 3.0
		DevGuide 3.0
		SPARCcompiler C
		FlexFax 2.1
		Ghostscript 2.5.2

Installation Notes
------------------

D 3
1) Defining "TRACE" in the Makefile builds a version with trace output
to stderr.
E 3
I 3
1) Building the "debug" target makes a version with symbols and which
also logs traces to stderr.
E 3

2) /var/spool/fax/bin/faxinfo must have world execute permission:

	chmod 755  /var/spool/fax/bin/faxinfo

3) The config file in /var/spool/fax/etc must specify at least 0644 in
order to be able to query the Receive Queue:

RecvFileMode:		0644		# recvd facsimiles *are* public


E 2
Known Bugs:
----------

1) There is an Xview bug (1071690) which causes the "Comments"
multiline text field to be obscured when you switch from "Status" to
"Send" mode.  There are 2 workarounds:  

	a) Go ahead and enter data into the "Comments" field anyway. It
	will be there even if you can't see it :-).  You can then
	Preview the Cover Page, prior to adding the actual documents to
	send.

	b) Run 2 copies of the tool.  One for Send and one for Status.


If you a) enhance this application, b) successfully port it to other
platforms or environments, or c) fix any bugs, please email the
undersigned and include the system information for your platform along
D 2
with any changes which you made to Faxtool.  I will include these in
E 2
I 2
with any changes which you made to FaxTool.  I will include these in

future releases along with the appropriate acknowledgement.
