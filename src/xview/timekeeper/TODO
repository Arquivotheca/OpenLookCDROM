Reporting software:

	Need a tkmonthend  that:
	- closes off each user's .timelog file and, if in a project,
	  updates it in the new .timelog file.
	- Move all files other than last month's into a central store.
	(Adapt from what johnc & others use)

File format:

	Let you annotate a single entry in the logfile.
	(or, as Lee puts it, both Projects and Activities)

X client:

	Add a "continue" button to reread the last line of the file.

	Get Delete working

	Insert new entries at top, not bottom.

	Need a way to reorder the list. Automatically: qsort by time.
	Manually: "Move to top". or just "Edit Topics"

	Timeout and notice_prompt if no activity for an hour, further timeout
	and writeLog("End", "Autologout") if no response.??

Batch client:
	add "-e -f" logic (msb)
