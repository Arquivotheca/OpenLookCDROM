Using the pre-built executable
-------------------------------
If you find the file mahjongg.sun4 in this directory, this is a pre-built
binary executable of XView mahjongg for Sun4/SPARC machines.
If you have OpenWindows 2.0 or 3.0, and a Sun4 or SPARC system with
SunOS 4.1.1 or better, this binary should run fine.  Add '.' to your
HELPPATH environment variable to enable access to the ./mahjongg.info
help file, and then just run "mahjongg.sun4".


To Build XView Mahjongg
-----------------------
If you are running OpenWindows 2.0 or 3.0, everything is configured
right for you, so just type "make" to build XView mahjongg.

If not in OpenWindows and some other X11 environment,
modify the makefile to set the two environment variables:

	XVIEWROOT
	XVIEWLIBDIR

-----
If your machine has Intel/VAX/... byte order run "make mahjongg.swap".

Before invoking mahjongg, make sure the mahjongg.info file is in
a directory that your $HELPPATH lists.  For a quick test, do one of
these:
	setenv HELPPATH .:$HELPPATH	# if HELPPATH is already set
or
	setenv HELPPATH .		# if HELPPATH is not set

and then run ./mahjongg.  With the mouse in the mahjongg window, hit
the Help key on your system.


To Build SunView Mahjongg
-------------------------
If you built XView mahjongg first, then do:
	cd sunview
	make -f Makefile.xvicons

If you have not built XView mahjongg, then
	cd sunview
	make


----------------------------------------------------------------
As far as naming the programs, I recommend the XView version be
called "mahjongg" and the SunView version (if you want both around)
be re-named to "mahjongg_sv", or be moved into a sub-directory for
SunView executables.
