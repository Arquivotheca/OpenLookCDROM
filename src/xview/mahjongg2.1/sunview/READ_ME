Here is a little something I wipped up in my spare time, because I
got tired of the complaints that there was only one PC in the
building that would play the version we already had. After the
flurry of "how do you do color" in sunspots, I figured I might as
well apply everything I learned there. Mahjongg plays both in color
and in monochrome "automagically" (with the exception of the 3/60,
which takes a switch). This is at BETA+ level. There are no
major systemic bugs left to the best of my knowledge, and it has been
beat on pretty thoroughly. The known quirks are listed in the man 
page and the README file.

Many thanks to Dorothy Robinson for here artistic ability in 
drawing the icons. Without her help we would have had funny little
stick figures. Also thanks to Jim Batch whom I tend to bug alot when
I'm programming.

Have Fun and let me know how you like it! Please reply to the address
listed below. I have to post from here as I don't have enough disk
space for news at home.
