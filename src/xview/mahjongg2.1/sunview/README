MAHJONGG Version 1.0

Copyright 1988 Mark A. Holm

Permission is given to copy and distribute for non-profit purposes.

This game will operate on any Sun hardware that I know of with either
a monochrome or a color bit mapped tube running Sun 3.2 UNIX or later.
Most of the development was done on a Sun 100U running Sun 3.5.

Please Note!! The automagic screen type determination will not recognize
all screen types unless compiled with <sys/fbio.h> from a 3.5 OS. If
compiled with 3.2 not all monochrome types are recognized. Also note that I did
not have enough time or alternate screen types to check out the 386.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1.	Unpack this kit in an empty directory and edit the Makefile to
	set MANLOC and DESTDIR to the appropriate locations. Define
	TARGET as RDRUNNER, if you're on a 386i. If it's a SPARC,
	you're on your own.

2.	run 'make install'.  

If you would like the patches to iconedit so you can modify the
icons, send a request (and possibly a small donation ;^) to the 
address below.

If you have any questions or problems/bug reports, send them to me:
