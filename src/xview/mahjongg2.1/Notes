Problems with Help behavior.
----------------------------
With XView 2.0 or OpenWindows 2.0, the help stuff (context-sensitve
help via the Help key, not the HELP button) doesn't work quite right
when you don't have a Help key on your system.  Without the key this
means you have to map some function key to Help, like this:
	xmodmap -e 'keysym F1 = Help'

But even with that, the help isn't found if you request help while
in the canvas window of the tool.  The help is found if you request
help in the panel area.

Didn't find this out until very recently.  I don't have a
work-around for it, but it appears to be fixed in
OpenWindows/XView 3.0, so I don't think I'll need to deal with it.
	

event_action()/event_id() and left/right-hand support
-----------------------------------------------------
The XView code uses event_id() throughout, rather than event_action().
Started to change this, and at the same time do something about
supporting left-handed operation of mahjongg, but things started
to get ugly and I backed the code out.

Seems to me that OpenWindows doesn't yet support left-handed
operation, at least not as well as SunView does.  Maybe if I get a
lot of requests for left-handed support, I'll do something about it.
