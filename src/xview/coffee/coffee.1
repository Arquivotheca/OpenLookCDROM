.SH NAME
.B coffee
[ new | half | ugh | empty ] | x | [ xview-options ] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Coffee
is a network-based coffee pot monitor, analogous to faces, vismon, et. al.
It displays the general state of the coffee pot, such as full,
half-full, old-and-bitter coffee, or completely empty.
The present version is manually operated with timeouts.
.LP
The program can be invoked in a command-line environment with one of
the arguments
.B full,
.B half,
.B ugh 
.B empty
or 
.B status.
These respectively set the status to full, half, old-and-undrinkable, or empty,
and display the status.
.LP
If invoked with any other argument, the program creates an X Window System
icon displaying one of the four modes shown above;
in this case, all arguments are passed to the X library (currently XView) so you
can specify -display xxx:0, -WP x y, etc. (it is safe to say "coffee X"
or similar if you want the display on localhost:0).
Opening the icon gives you a set of buttons that let you select
the appropriate mode; the window auto-iconifies after you select
a mode.
.LP
If invoked with no argument, it prints a status message.
.SH FILES
The path to STATFILE is hardcoded in the coffee.h file.
It normally refers to an NFS-mounted file in a pub-writable directory.
.SH HISTORY
First (XView) version written by
Ian Darwin, SoftQuad Inc., Toronto,  August, 1992.
.SH BUGS
.LP
A broadcast RPC mechanism would have been better than a status file.
.LP
There is no way to indicate ``coffee is made but we're out of milk.''
.LP
There should be an odor sensor which would indicate
when the coffee has turned bitter.
Or a weight sensor, and a guage display, to indicate exact fullness.
These will be incorporated in a future release, shortly after the
Brooklyn Bridge changes hands.
.LP
There ought to be a TimBits option. \- rph
.LP
You tend to drink more coffee when you can see whenever a fresh pot
is available. Such is the price of omniscience.
.LP
Drinking coffee during pregnancy will make the baby jittery.
.LP
Brewed coffee always smells better than it tastes.
