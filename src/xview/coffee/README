This is just a simple demo showing how to use varying icons
to display the state of a coffee pot, in which the taste of
the coffee is assumed to degrade rapidly over time.

Note that the same program is used under X to display the state
of the coffee pot and at the UNIX command line to update the state;
if invoked with certain arguments, it doesn't connect to the X server.
