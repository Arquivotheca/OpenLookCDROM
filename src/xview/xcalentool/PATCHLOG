Version 2.3X, Patch0
====================

This version adds ifdefs to support Solaris 2.X, using X11R5 and fixes the
following bugs:
	common.c - close current day before re-reading appts file; truncate
			pasted appts to daysize.
	dpaint.c - timestring array was two bytes too small
	init.c - deleted extra arg on XDrawPoint() calls
	printer.c - print "this week" instead of "today" when printing a
			weeks worth of appointements.
	tool.c - sgc was used when NO_SUN_MOON was defined (it should have
			been #ifdef'd out).
	event.c - set WMHints each time we change the icon
	calentool.c - don't expire someone elses appts when printing them
	devent.c - don't allow modification of appts on read-only files
	printer.c - day shown in mail subject is off by one; mail was sent
			even if there were no appts for the week.
	event.c, calentool.c - fix problem with window mgrs other than olwm
			that caused the icon not to get properly updated or
			displayed.
	calentool.c, tool.c - FINALLY!!! I got the XView color stuff working
			right, so it will get the colors from your resource
			db or the command line.
		- add support for ISO date format YY-MM-DD (see -D option)
		- add Swedish day and month names

The code has also been cleaned up enough that it will compile cleanly with
gcc 2.2.3 on SunOS 4.1.3 and gcc 2.5.8 on Solaris 2.3 using the "-Wall" flag.

Version 2.2X, Patch1

	devent.c - trying to grab input foces when it shouldn't
	tool.c	- correct the default font specification
	utils.c	- add additional declarations needed by cuserid()
	Ct.Xdefaults - correct sample font specifications
	Ct.Xdefaults - change comment style from /* */ to !

Version 2.2X, Patch0
