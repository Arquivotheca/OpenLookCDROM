CALENTOOL - Version 2.3X


Calentool is a day/week/month/year-at-glance tool for Workstations
and X terminals.  The windowed display interface uses XView (2.0 or 3.0)
and X11R4 or X11R5 to present an Open Look style user interface (including
the Help key!). A SunView version is also available.

One can view a single day's appointments and notes, a weeks worth (with
abbreviated messages), a month at a time (with appointment flags) or a year
at a time (with appointment flags).  Alternate appointment files can be
specified to allow checking other users' schedules.

Recurring appointments (e.g every Monday or every 1st & 3rd Tuesday),
as well as a reminder of future appointments are available.

Interesting information about the sun and moon is also available for viewing.

See the man page for all the gory details.  Also see the INSTALL file for
installation instructions.

Conversion programs are supplied to convert from some of the other
common calendar program appointment files to calentool's file format.

Version 2.2 was tested on Sun 3/50, Sun 3/60, 3/160, 3/180, 3/260, 3/280, IPC, SS1,
SS1+ and SS2, all running SunOS 4.1 or 4.1.1 using MIT X11R4pl18 and Sun's
Openwindows both in monochrome and color with various combinations of olwm, twm
and mwm window managers. It has also been tested with XView3 and olwm3 on a
SS2 running SunOS 4.1.1 and with OpenWindows 3 (Beta). Finally, it has also been
tested on a CDC 4000 running EP/IX 1.4.1 (a MIPS like architecture) and
possibly other configurations as well. I've also run it on a Tek XP29 color
X Terminal.

See the file Ct.Xdefaults for a list of X resources that are recognized by
calentool.

		*** Note about Version 2.3 ***

This version has been tested on a Sun SS2 running 4.1.3U1_revB compiled
with both the standard cc and with gcc 2.2.3 and on a Sun Sparc 10 running
Solaris 2.3 using gcc 2.5.8. It has also been tested with gcc 2.5.8 on a
486 running Linux 1.1.18.

		*** Note about Solaris 2.3 ***

The cleanest compile I received was to install XView3.2 (from ftp.x.org) and
utilize a local /usr/X11, release 5 (patch level 26) distribution.

This gains you two benefits:

	Keeps a pristine /usr/openwin.
	Provides a slew of XView config files.

When you do this, make sure that XView.cf has:
	 The proper PIC flags to pass to your compiler.
	 Has the proper XVDestDir devined.
	 Has the proper 'strconst' string defined.
