Sweeper is a game where your task is to find the hidden mines in a minefield.

To play the game move your mouse pointer to a square and press the left
mouse button to mark that you think this is safe square. If there is a
mine on this square the game is over. If there is no mine on this square
a number will be shown that shows home many mines there are in the
surronding squares. All surrounding squares, even those diagonally are 
counted.

If you think there is a mine on a square you move the mousepointer to that
square and press the middle button. If you want to unmark a square that
you thought that there is a mine on just press the middle button again.

If you click with the left button on a mine all squares will be revealed
to you. The squares that you have marked will be shaded, all other squares 
will be white. A faulty marked bomb will be marked with a cross over it.
