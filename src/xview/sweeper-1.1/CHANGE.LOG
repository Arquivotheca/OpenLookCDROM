Ver. 1.1 (12 October 1992)
--------------------------------------------------

Larger font for the numbers displayed in the squares to improve readability.

Sweeper now accepts the standard Xview options on startup.

Function clock renamed to tick_clock. The name clock caused name clash
on some systems (f.ex HP-UX).

Corrected a problem with the clock starting to count directly when New Game button 
was selected instead of when the first square was selected.

if you start the game from a pty, there isn't an entry in
/etc/utmp so getlogin() fails.  I have added a check to use
getpwuid() if getlogin() fails.

The string used to display the clock was too short and causes a
memory overwrite.
