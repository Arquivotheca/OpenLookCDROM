DESCRIPTION

     This  is  the  "README" file for xvset(1), an Open Look
interface for the functions of xset(1).  xset(1) provides  a
means  from  the  command  line of altering user preferences
stored by the X server, such as mouse, bell, font path,  and
keyboard  settings.   xvset(1) implements a graphical method
of accessing a subset of the functionality of xset(1) by us-
ing  the  XView toolkit to poll the user for information and
then calling Xlib functions to set  the  proper  values  (in
contrast  to older versions of xvset(1), which actually exe-
cuted  xset(1)  with  appropriate  command-line  arguments).
Specifically,  xvset(1)  allows the user to change the mouse
acceleration and threshold; bell volume,  pitch,  and  dura-
tion; keyboard auto-repeat; and screen saver timeout, cycle,
blanking, and exposure setting.

BUILDING AND INSTALLING

     The development  environment  for  xvset(1)  was  Linux
1.0.8  with  XView 3.2.  The only other platform for testing
was SunOS 4.1.3.  For Linux  systems,  "make  install"  will
compile  and install the binary, and "make install.man" will
install the man page and help file.  For SunOS, "make  sunos
install" will compile and install the binary.  Other systems
may require that the makefile be  edited  to  reflect  local
path names and compiler flags.
