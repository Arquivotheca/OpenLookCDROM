:mouse_acceleration
This panel item controls the mouse acceleration.  The mouse, or whatever pointer the machine is connected to, will go "acceleration" times as fast when it travels more than "threshold" pixels in a short time.  Thus the mouse can be used for precise alignment when moved slowly but can be set to travel across the screen by a flick of the wrist when desired.

:mouse_threshold
This panel item controls the mouse threshold.  The mouse, or whatever pointer the machine is connected to, will go "acceleration" times as fast when it travels more than "threshold" pixels in a short time.  Thus the mouse can be used for precise alignment when moved slowly but can be set to travel across the screen by a flick of the wrist when desired.
#

:bell_volume
This panel item controls the bell volume.  The number represents the percentage of full volume.  Note that some hardware may be unable to vary the bell characteristics.  The X server will set the characteristics of the bell as closely as it can to the user's specifications.
#

:bell_pitch
This panel item controls the bell pitch.  The number represents the pitch in hertz.  The limits of the control are arbitrary.  Note that some hardware may be unable to vary the bell characteristics.  The X server will set the characteristics of the bell as closely as it can to the user's specifications.
#

:bell_duration
This panel item controls the bell duration.  The number represents the duration in milliseconds.  Note that some hardware may be unable to vary the bell characteristics.  The X server will set the characteristics of the bell as closely as it can to the user's specifications.
#

:auto-repeat
This panel item controls the auto-repeat feature for the keyboard.  A check in the box enables auto-repeat, while a blank box disables auto-repeat.
#

:screen_saver_timeout
This panel item controls the timeout of the X server's screen saver.  The number represents the length of time in seconds the server must be inactive for the screen saver to be activated.  A setting of zero effectively disables the screen saver.  The upper limit of the control is arbitrary.
#

:screen_saver_cycle
This panel item controls the cycle time of the X server's screen saver.  The number represents the length of time in seconds between changes in the background pattern to avoid burn-in.  The limits of the control are arbitrary.
#

:blanking
This panel item controls the blanking preference of the X server's screen saver.  "Blank" sets the preference to blank the video (if the hardware can do so) rather than to display a background pattern, while "Noblank" set the preference to display a pattern rather than to blank the video.
#

:exposures
This panel item controls the preference of the X server's screen saver for window exposures.  "Expose" sets the preference to allow window exposures (the server can freely discard window contents), while "Noexpose" sets the preference to disable the screen saver unless the server can regenerate the screens without causing exposure events.
#

:apply
When this panel item is selected, all settings and options as displayed by the controls on the panel will take effect.
#

:defaults
When this panel item is selected, the controls and options displayed will be changed to relect the server's default settings.  The changes will not take effect unless the "Apply" button is pressed.
