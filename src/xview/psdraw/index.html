<P>
This is another XView drawing program based on NeWS and XVPS.
Unlike painter, this one works. The trick is that, to draw
any of the shapes, say a rectangle, you have to click and release
the left (SELECT) button in one corner, move to the opposite corner,
and click the middle (EXTEND) button. Makes perfect sense in the
context of OPEN LOOK.
