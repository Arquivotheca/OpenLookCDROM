xwb is an editor for Xwindows, using the Xview library.
It allows editing of any ascii text and has as free-
configurable menu to enable using any compiling or
text formatting program in a more comfortable way,
by mouse click. The configuration for C and for TeX
is included; if a file with extension .tex or .c
is loaded, the configuration is automatically selected
for the compiler/formatter.

Yet the first version may have some bugs, so need reports
where they occur. Some are domumented in the README-file.

This editor is available at ftp.gwdh.de in pub/linux/misc/editors
I sent a copy to sunsite.unc.edu, so maybe it could be found there now.
