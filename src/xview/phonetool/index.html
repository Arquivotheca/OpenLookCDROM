Phonetool is a neat desk accessory: it takes the place of those
little pink Phone Message pads, and sends the message by email.
Quoting the man page:
<BR>
phonetool
is an OPEN LOOK application that was originally created to run
under Sun's OpenWindows environment.  It is written in XView, and its
code skeleton was created using Sun's DevGuide product.
<BR>
phonetool is a simple message-sending tool.  It does nothing that regular email
won't do, but it is designed to reduce the typing involved when
intercepting a call for a fellow worker who's not at his/her desk.
