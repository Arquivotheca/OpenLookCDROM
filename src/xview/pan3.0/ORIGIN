Extracts from Pan 3.0 README:

About Pan:

Pan is an Open Look X Windows Post A Note program.  It is basically a note
manager program.  It organizes notes into folders.  Each note may be hidden or
visible.  If it is visible, it is mapped to a window on the display.  The
note's state, position, and size are "remembered" across invocations of Pan.

Some of Pan's features are:

    o  Multiple folders
    o  Number of notes limited only by memory (swap space).
    o  Re-sizable notes with full text editing capabilities.
    o  Note text size limited only by machine resources.
    o  Command line control language.
    o  Flexible note searching features.
    o  Flexible note printing features.

Version 3.0:

I have only built and tested Pan 3.0 under Open Windows V3 on a sun4 platform.
I have tried to remain compatible with OW2.0, but I may have accidentally
used a new feature, or attribute.  If Pan 3.0 won't compile or work correctly
under OW2.0, get Pan 2.4 and use it.
