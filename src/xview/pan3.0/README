About Pan:

Pan is an Open Look X Windows Post A Note program.  It is basically a note
manager program.  It organizes notes into folders.  Each note may be hidden or
visible.  If it is visible, it is mapped to a window on the display.  The
note's state, position, and size are "remembered" across invocations of Pan.

Some of Pan's features are:

    o  Multiple folders
    o  Number of notes limited only by memory (swap space).
    o  Re-sizable notes with full text editing capabilities.
    o  Note text size limited only by machine resources.
    o  Command line control language.
    o  Flexible note searching features.
    o  Flexible note printing features.

New Features in Version 3.0 (in no particular order):

    o  Abbreviated button with user configurable menu for quick searching
       for notes by title.
    o  Notes now have an Action menu button with Print, Width, and Destroy
       menu items.  (It is now harder to accidentally destroy a note.)
    o  Width option from note's Action menu will automatically expand
       a note to a specified character width.
    o  Windows and the widgets within them are now created and positioned
       better.  Pan now handles the -scale option and different fonts
       better.
    o  Command line control interface for Pan
        o  X resource to control processing interval.
        o  X resource to enable/disable logging
    o  X resources for top, bottom, left, and right window border margins.
       Allows for better interaction with window managers other than olwm.
    o  X resource for title length limit in menus.  Also, better "fitting"
       of titles in menus with proportional fonts.
    o  Quit menu item now at bottom of Action menu.  (Fewer accidental quits).
        o  X resource to specify default action of Action menu
    o  X resource to limit the number of notes exposed by a single action.
       Prevents accidental "over exposures" leading to over usage of swap
       resources.
    o  X resource to independently set the text subwindow font.
    o  X resource to allow display of folder name in note's title bar.
    o  Handles iconified notes better.
    o  Matching notes window now re-sizable
    o  Move notes window now re-sizable
    o  New (different) icon for the main Pan window
    o  Visual feedback on folder creation
    o  All pop ups now have a class of "Pan"
    o  X Resources to specify initial size of new notes.
    o  Support for drag and drop of a note to another application

History:

I wrote this program after seeing a couple of X based post-it style programs
and deciding that none of them did exactly what I wanted.  Note that I intend
no insult by this statement - I simply wanted different functionality.  Pan has
gone through several in-house revisions.  Some of the available options
were requested by individual users of the program.  Because of this, they
may not seem generally useful.

Version 3.0 is the second public release of Pan.  It is greatly enhanced
and incorporates many user requested features.

Version 2.4 is the first version that I publicly distributed.

If you find bugs, or mis-features, or want enhancements, feel free to send
me e-mail.  Note, however, that I can promise nothing.  I may or may not do
what you request.  It depends upon my available free time, current work
load, and whether I feel it is generally desirable or feasible.

Caveats:

A lot of people have been using this program for quite a while, and I haven't
gotten a single complaint about a lost note due to program error.  However,
as we all know, there is always a first.  In other words, I think pan is
pretty trustworthy, but I wouldn't bet my life on it!

Version 3.0:

I have only built and tested Pan 3.0 under Open Windows V3 on a sun4 platform.
I have tried to remain compatible with OW2.0, but I may have accidentally
used a new feature, or attribute.  If Pan 3.0 won't compile or work correctly
under OW2.0, get Pan 2.4 and use it.

If I forgot anybody, or left something off of the list, my apologies.

Version 2.4:

I've only ever built this under Open Windows (v2 & v3) on a sun4 platform.
I don't know whether it will build and run under any other configuration.

Building pan:

Basically, pan needs the xview library, the olgx library, and the X11 library.
It also needs the X and xview include files.

To build pan, make sure OPENWINHOME is set in the environment and
then run make.  If this doesn't work, take a look at the Makefile and
see if you can modify it for your configuration.  The included Makefile
is pathetically simple.

Note that to include drag and drop of notes to other applications, PAN_DND
must be defined during the compile.  This feature is available *only* under
OW/Xview V3.x.

If you are compiling under BSD, make sure that you (or your compiler) defines
BSD.  This is necessary because of some header file differences.

Note that if you use a more strict (or ANSI) compiler, you might get lots
of warnings.  I haven't gone through and made sure that I always cast the
return value from xv_get() everywhere and I might have been sloppy elsewhere
too.  I apologize if this causes any grief.

SCRIPTS FOR CONTROL LANGUAGE EXECUTION

Two scripts are included for support of control language execution.  The
control language is documented in the manual entry for pan.  However, I did
not get the chance to write manual entries for the scripts.  They are 
very simplistic, so using them shouldn't be a problem.  Briefly:

pancmd - Allows the queuing of control language statements to be executed
         by pan.  Usage is:

pancmd [-user <username>] [-dir <pan directory>] [-now] <pan command> <arguments> ...

    -user - specify another user name to use to locate the pan directory.
            Uses $HOME/.pan as the default.

    -dir  - specify the full pan directory path name.

    -now  - attempt to signal the running pan to execute the command
            immediately.

	Command Language Syntax:

	expose    title <title RE> [windowmax <max # to expose>]
	hide      title <title RE>
	move      source <folder> title <title RE> destination <folder>
	newfolder folder <name>
	newnote   [folder <folder>] [title <title>] [size <width> <height>]
		  [location <x> <y>] [hidden|visible|veiled] [file <name>]
	print     folder <folder> title <title RE>
	quit
	veil      title <title RE>

panlog - Allows viewing and removal of the pan log file.   This file contains
         the results of execution of control language statements.  Usage:

panlog [-user <username>] [-dir <pan directory>] [-remove] [-quiet]

    -user   - specify another user name to use to locate the pan directory.
              Uses $HOME/.pan as the default.

    -dir    - specify the full pan directory path name.

    -remove - remove the log after displaying it.

    -quiet  - do not display the log.
