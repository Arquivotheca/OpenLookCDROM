 *	ROLO - A Sun Tool to implement a Rolodex-style list of notes
 *
 *	This code manipulates "cards" in a visual manner approximating
 *	a rolodex file.  All the cards are stored in one real file, the
 *	cards are seperated by a ^L (form-feed).  The default path
 *	name is $HOME/.rolo.  A different pathname may be specified at
 *	startup on the command line.  The pathname is relative to the
 *	user's home directory.
 *
 *	Due to bugs in the 3.0 distribution, especially with text subwindows,
 *	this code is only guaranteed to compile and run properly with 3.2
 *	or greater.
 *
 *	This code is public domain, anyone and everyone is welcome to it.
 *	All I ask is that my name and this notice remain on it.  If Sun would
 *	like to bundle it with their product they are welcome to do so,
 *	I only ask that the sources be included in the binary distribution.
 *
 *	Please return any fixes, improvements, gripes, etc to me.
