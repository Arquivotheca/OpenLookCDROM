   This is Rolo Version 2.0.  There is nothing tricky about compiling this,
just unpack everything in a directory and type 'make'.  You may need to
change the target directories in the Makefile if you want to do a
'make install', or you can just compile it and copy the binary and man
page to your favorite locations.

   As far as I know, this code should work on any Sun running 3.2 or
greater, though I personally have only seen it run on a 3.4 3/60C and a
3.2 monochrome 3/160.  If you notice strange behaviour on any hardware/software
combination please let me know (a fix would be nice too...).  Since the
initial release, I've been told that Rolo runs on Sun4s and 386s.  There
was a bug in the initial release which caused a seg fault on Sun4s at startup,
it was fixed in patch 1.

   The Makefile defines the symbol STANDALONE to determine the name of
the main() function.  That is for merging the binary into the toolmerge
library for linking with the other suntools binaries.  If you know what that
means, you'll probably know how to merge Rolo into the combined suntools binary.
If not, don't worry about it, Rolo runs just fine by itself.  In any case,
that silliness is unnecessary with 4.0 and beyond, so it will not be an issue
for much longer.

   Please report any problems, suggestions, bug fixes, etc to me at the
email address below.  Please feel free to pass Rolo around, it is public
domain and carries no restrictions.  I only ask that if you give it to someone,
that you give them everything, source code, man page, the works.  And if
you hack on it, please try to get the changes back to me so that I can make
an attempt to keep things in sync.  Enjoy.
