README file for XVmines v1.0				By Manolis Lourakis
							March 1993

1. Compiling

XVmines runs under the X-Window System.It is written using the XView
window package.  Supposing that you have XView installed,all you have
to do to compile xvmines is to set the environment variable OPENWINHOME
to point to the directory where XView files are stored,type xmkmf to
create the appropriate makefile and finally type make to start
compilation.If OPENWINHOME is not set,the makefile will try to use
directory /usr/openwin.The makefile uses the native C-compiler by
default, but it can be changed to use any gcc-like compiler (provided
that it defines the __STDC__ macro).

In sum:
 % zcat xvmines-1.0.tar.Z | tar -xvf -
 % cd xvmines-1.0
#Set OPENWINHOME
 % xmkmf
 % make

2. Machines
XVmines has been compiled sucessfully under SunOS4.1.{1,2,3}

3. Availability
XVmines is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.csd.uch.gr (147.52.16.2)
Sources are in /pub/X/xvmines-1.0.tar.Z


Have fun.
