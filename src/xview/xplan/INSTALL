XPLAN INSTALLATION PROCEDURE (last updated December 12, 1992)

(1) EXTRACT FILES FROM TAR FILE

Assuming you have not yet extracted xplan from diskette, do the
following:

	Insert diskette in drive, and type:

	tar xvf /dev/rfd0

rfd0 may not be the correct device for your machine --- check with
vendor documentation

At this point you should have the following directory structure:

	xplan/
		bin/
		src/

(2) BUILD XPLAN
Move into the xplan/src directory

	cd xplan/src

To build the program, type:

	make

to create an executable version of xplan which will be placed in the
bin directory.

(3) SETTING UP YOUR WORK ENVIRONMENT

Now you need to set up the help path, so the help text for xplan will
be displayed when you use your help key.  An example help path might
be:

	setenv HELPPATH /usr/openwin/lib/help:/usr/openwin/lib/locale:/usr/lacey/xplan/src

The one thing that is essential for xplan is that you have your help
path pointing to the location of the .info files that are included in
the src directory as distributed.

If you plan on using xplan a lot you might want to add the bin
directory to your PATH environment variable, too.

(4) SUMMARY

xplan is now installed, and if your PATH is set up correctly you
should be able to run it by simply typing 'xplan' at the command
prompt from any directory.
