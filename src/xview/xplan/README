Hello and welcome to xplan version 1.0 (the final version, I wouldn't
doubt ;-).  xplan was written as a semester long project in CPS 470,
Software Engineering, and Michigan State University, Fall Semester
1992.  The authors were:

Brian Gaubert, Mark M. Lacey, Richard Malingkas, and Mike Marlow

There is absolutely no plan for any of the authors, or anybody else at
Michigan State University or elsewhere to support xplan.  Use it at
your own risk.

We hope you find it useful, or are able to extend it in ways that make
it even more useful to you.  The file INSTALL explains how to install
xplan on your system.  The file COPYING explains the restrictions
placed on distributing and modifying xplan.  READ IT BEFORE USE.

Below is a list of source files included in the distribution, along
with a list of known bugs.

			Enjoy,

			Mark M. Lacey
			(and the rest of the authors)

KNOWN ERRORS/OMMISSIONS

There seems to be a problem deleting resources sometimes, and it is
most likely a problem with the code in db.c.

Exporting PERT charts to LaTeX was never completed due to time
constraints.
