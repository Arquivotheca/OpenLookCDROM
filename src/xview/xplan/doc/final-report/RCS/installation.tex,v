\section{Installation Procedure}
\label{sec:install}

Before trying to install \xplan, please read sections \ref{hw-req} and
\ref{sw-req} which discuss the hardware and software requirements of
\xplan.  If your system does not meet these requirements, it is
possible that you will not be able to build \xplan\ without first making
modifications to it.

\subsection{Extract Files From Tar File}

Assuming you have not yet extracted \xplan\ from diskette, do the
following:

    Insert diskette in drive, and type:
\begin{verbatim}
    tar xvf /dev/rfd0
\end{verbatim}
rfd0 may not be the correct device for your machine --- check with
vendor documentation

At this point you should have the following directory structure:
\begin{verbatim}
    xplan/
       bin/
       projects/
       src/
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Build \xplan}

Move into the xplan/src directory
\begin{verbatim}
    cd xplan/src
\end{verbatim}

To build the program, type:
\begin{verbatim}
    make
\end{verbatim}
to create an executable version of \xplan\ which will be placed in the
bin directory.

\subsection{Setting Up Your Work Environment}

Now you need to set up the help path, so the help text for \xplan\ will
be displayed when you use your help key.  An example help path might
be:
\begin{verbatim}
   setenv HELPPATH /usr/openwin/lib/help:/usr/lacey/xplan/src
\end{verbatim}
The one thing that is essential for \xplan\ is that you have your help
path pointing to the location of the .info files that are included in
the src directory as distributed.

If you plan on using \xplan\ a lot you might want to add the bin
directory to your PATH environment variable, too.

\subsection{Summary}

\xplan\ is now installed, and if your PATH is set up correctly you
should be able to run it by simply typing 'xplan' at the command
prompt from any directory.

xplan is distributed in a compressed tar file format, and can be
received from various anonymous ftp sites.  Once received, you should
run {\tt uncompress} on the tar file to de-compress it.  Then, {\tt
tar xvf filename} (where {\tt filename} is the name of the tar file)
should be used to un-tar the contents of the archive.  Once this has
been done, the user will have an {\tt xplan} directory in which the
source files will be located.  Next the user should enter the {\tt
xplan} directory and run {\tt make} to build the program.  If any
compilation errors occur (which might happen if the user is trying to
build the program in an environment different than the one it was
developed in) the user will have to determine what the problem is and
take action to correct it.

At this point the program has been installed and should run without
error.  To begin xplan, the user types {\tt xplan} at the command
prompt.
