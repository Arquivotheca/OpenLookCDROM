\section{User Scenarios}

\subsection{Creating New Task Information}

To create new task information, the options of the ``Insert'' menu on
the main window (see Figure~\ref{window:project2} on
page~\pageref{window:project2}) of \xplan\ are used.  These options include
``Before'', ``After'', ``Top'', and ``Bottom''.  The default option is
to insert at the bottom of the list.  So, to create a list of tasks,
first select ``Bottom'' from the insert menu.  This will cause the
``Task Information'' window to pop up (see Figure
\ref{projdesc:taskinfo}) .  In this window you can enter
the information for a single task.  For instance, in the example,
information for a project description task has been entered.  Once
``Apply'' is pressed in this window, the name on the task list (which
is in the main window) will be updated, and the information will be
stored in the task database.

\begin{figure}

\centerline{\psfig{figure=main-window.ps,height=4in}}
\caption[Project Window]{The project window and its menus.}
\label{window:project2}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

\centerline{\psfig{figure=proj-des-task-info.ps,height=4in}}
\caption[Project Description Task Info]{Task Information for 
Project Description.}
\label{projdesc:taskinfo}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

\centerline{\psfig{figure=resources.ps,height=3in}}
\caption[Resources pop-up window]{Resources pop-up window.}
\label{resources:win}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\centerline{\psfig{figure=dependency.ps,height=3in}}
\caption[Dependency pop-up window]{Dependency pop-up window.}
\label{dependency:win}
\end{figure}

Creating a list of tasks is done by repeating this process of using
the ``Insert'' menu on the main window.  Once the entire task list has
been entered, it can be saved to a file on disk, which will be
explained in the next section.

\subsection{Saving Task Information to Disk}

To save task information to disk, select either the ``Save'' or ``Save
as...'' options from the ``File'' menu of the main window (see
Figure~\ref{menu:file2} on page~\pageref{menu:file2}).  The ``Save
as...'' option is used when a file does not yet have a name or when
you want to save a copy to another name.  ``Save'', on the other saves
the file to whatever name was used last in loading/saving files.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\centerline{\psfig{figure=file-menu.ps,height=1in}}
\caption[File Menu]{The file menu of the project window.}
\label{menu:file2}
\end{figure}

If ``Save as...'' is selected, a file listing pops up.  This is like
the standard file listers of OpenWindows.  All files with a ``.prj''
extension will be listed.  By going to the ``Directory'' prompt,
entering a new directory name and pressing ``Return'' on the keyboard,
you can switch directories.  Directories can also be switched by
clicking on the name of a directory if it appears in the file listing.

A filename can be entered in the ``File'' prompt, or selected off of
the list.  If the name is entered in the prompt and ``Return'' is
pressed, the file is loaded.  If the file is selected from the
scrolling list, ``Save'' must be selected to load it.

\subsection{Viewing PERT and Gantt Charts on Screen}

Once the information for a task has been entered into the system, PERT
and Gantt charts can be viewed.  By selecting ``PERT'' in the
``Chart'' menu of the main window, a PERT chart window will be created
(see Figure~\ref{pert:chart} on page~\pageref{pert:chart})
with the PERT chart for the current project file.  For the PERT chart
to be correct, all dependencies for all tasks will have to have been
specified in the creation or later modification of the tasks.

Selecting ``Gantt'' in that same menu will bring up the Gantt chart
(see Figure~\ref{gantt:chart} on page~\pageref{gantt:chart})
for this project.  For the Gantt chart to be correct, all planned
start and end dates for the tasks will have to have been entered.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\centerline{\psfig{figure=test_pert.ps,width=4in}}
\caption[PERT Chart]{An example of a PERT chart.}
\label{pert:chart}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\centerline{\psfig{figure=test_gantt.ps,width=4in}}
\caption[Gantt Chart]{An example of a Gantt chart.}
\label{gantt:chart}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Changing Task Information}

By selecting the name of a task from the task list in the main window,
the user is able to bring up the information for that task in the task
information window.  Changes can be made to the information for that
task and then ``Apply'' can be selected to store the information.

\subsection{Checking Dependencies}

To verify that there are no dependency loops, select ``Check
Dependencies'' from the ``Analyze'' menu (see Figure~\ref{menu:analyze2} on
page~\pageref{menu:analyze2}).  You will be notified if there
is a problem with the dependencies for the tasks that have been
entered.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\centerline{\psfig{figure=analyze-menu.ps,height=1in}}
\caption[Analyze Menu]{The analyze menu of the project window.}
\label{menu:analyze2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Date Calculations}

To calculate the planned start and end dates for all of the tasks in
the task list based upon their durations, along with the start and end
dates for the project, select ``Date Calculation'' from the
``Analyze'' menu (see Figure~\ref{menu:analyze2} on
page~\pageref{menu:analyze2}).  This will cause the earliest and
latest start and end dates for the tasks to be calculated, and the
planned start and end dates for the tasks will be filled in with the
earliest and latest start and end dates.  This feature saves the user
from having to enter anything other than task names, descriptions,
durations, dependencies, and then the planned start date for the
project in the first task, and then planned end date in the last task.

\subsection{Exporting to \LaTeX}

The ``Export'' menu (see Figure~\ref{menu:export2} on
page~\pageref{menu:export2}) contains options to export task sheets
and Gantt charts to \LaTeX\ format files which use the picture
environment. There is also an option for PERT charts, but currently it
only draws the PERT boxes, and not dependency lines.

In xplan's main window labeled ``xplan'' the task names for a project
are listed in a scrolling list.  If you loaded the file from disk (by
selecting the Load option from the File Menu), you will see task names
listed.  If you are starting from scratch (by selecting the New
Project option from the File Menu), you will be given an empty
scrolling list.  In order to input task information into the system,
click on the Insert Menu and select either ``Before'', ``After'',
``Top'' or ``Bottom''.

Whenever a task's information is to be created or edited by the GUI, a
popup window labeled ``Task Information'' will appear with all of the
task related information described in the Functionality Description
section of this document.  For items such as task name, task
description, task options, task dates, and task times, you may
directly type in this popup window. See Figure
~\ref{projdesc:taskinfo}.

To display and edit Task Dependencies and Task Resources Lists, you
click the left button of the mouse on the control buttons labeled
``Dependencies'' and ``Resources'' in the ``Task Information'' window.
When you click on the ``Resources'' control button, a popup window
like the one in Figure~\ref{resources:win} will appear.  Similarly, if
you click on the ``Dependencies'' button, a window like the one in
Figure~\ref{dependency:win} will appear.

After you have finished creating or editing a task, you must decide if
you want to save that tasks new information.  Pressing the left button
of the mouse on the ``Apply'' button of the Task Information popup
window will save the new task, or changes made to an old task's
information.  Pressing the left button of the mouse on the ``Reset''
button will cancel the changes made to an existing task, or not create
the new task.

Now you can display the resulting PERT and Gantt charts by selecting
the corresponding options on Chart Menu. The PERT chart will look like
Figure~\ref{pert:chart}, while the Gantt chart will look like
Figure~\ref{gantt:chart}.

These windows operations are self-explanatory for the user who is
familiar with using graphical user interfaces (GUI) designed for
software running in an X Windows environment.  However, if you need
help while running xplan in real time, you may use the help facilities
provided by the GUI.  If are using the Sun SPARCstation 1 or 2, press
the ``Help'' key and use the mouse to select the item you are
interested in being helped with.  The GUI and online help capabilities
for xplan were developed with OpenWindows Developer's Guide 3.0 for
use on a Sun SPARCstation.  If you are not using a Sun SPARCstation,
you will need to consult you workstation's manual for how to utilize
the equivalent of the ``Help'' key present on Sun keyboards.

For additional help, this manual is included in the xplan delivery
package of a compressed tar file.  This manual is provided in
PostScript format for the user to view either online, or generate a
hard copy by using a PostScript laser printer.

After you have created a project task list in xplan for your project
and viewed the PERT/Gantt charts, you may save your work to ASCII text
file format for further xplan processing at a later date, or to the
\LaTeX\ file format for incorporating PERT charts, Gantt charts, and
Task Sheet into professional quality documents.  Those documents
regarding your project may then be put into PostScript format for
electronic distribution on computer networks and the Internet, or
laser printed in a hard copy format to paper or overhead slides for
presentations.  We recommend that the user obtain \cite{latex-manual}
if unfamiliar with \LaTeX\.  Since \LaTeX\ is also provided as
freeware, the budget conscious user can productively utilize the
xplan software by using it in conjunction with \LaTeX\ as part of a
total document processing system for generating reports and
information regarding the status of the project being managed.
