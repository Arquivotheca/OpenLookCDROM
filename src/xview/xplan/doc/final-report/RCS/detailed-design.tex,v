@\section{Detailed Design}

\subsection{Data Description}

On page~6 subtasks are mentioned.  As previously specified in this
document, subtasks were not implemented.

\subsection{Interfaces Within Structure}

Page~8 refers to the Gantt generation using the calculation subsystem.
This is not the case.  As previously specified in this document, the
Gantt formatting is done locally by the Gantt routines.

\subsection{Write File Module Detailed Description}

Page~52 and 53 do not incorporate a new function which was added,
called write-file-init.  This is also mentioned in the addendum to the
preliminary design.
