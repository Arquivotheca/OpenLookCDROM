@\section{Summary of Changes and Addendums}

The main changes that were made in the design and implementation dealt
with dropping subtasks as a feature, and in modifying the flow of data
from the calculation subsystem to the Gantt chart generators.  As
mentioned, the Gantt charts do their own formatting calculations
locally as opposed to using formatting information from the
calculations system.
