@\section{Calculations Subsystem}
The following are the errors found on Calculation subsystem :
\begin{itemize}
\item The planned end date for the first task is not filled in when the user 
choose {\em Date Calculation} from the {\em Analyze} menu. The user must enter 
the date manually.
\item The negative float is not supported. When a task has a negative float,
the values stored in the database for latest start/end dates are INT-MAX as
defined in <limits.h>.
\end{itemize}
