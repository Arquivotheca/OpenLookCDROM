@\section{\LaTeX\ Subsystem}
The errors contained in the \LaTeX\ generation subsystem include:

\begin{itemize}

\item When the
Gantt charts are printed, the milestones, tasks that have the same
start and end dates, and the tasks that start at the end of the page
in the output will carry that information to the next page. 

\item The \LaTeX\ output of the PERT charts contain the boxes only. The
procedure to produce the lines is there but contains errors so it was
commented out. The only thing that will appear on the PERT boxes is
the task name. 

\end{itemize}
