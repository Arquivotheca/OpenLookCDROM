@\section{Software Project Plan}

\subsection{Introduction}

On page~1, paragraph~2 it is stated that the user can double-click on
the task list to bring up the information for a specific task.  This
is no longer true.  The user now simply has to select the task from
the list with a single click.  All references to double clicking in
future documents (requirements specification, design documents, etc.)
are also invalid.

Paragraph~3 on this same page mentions keeping track of a sub-task
list.  This feature was eliminated due to the complexity in
conjunction with the very short period of time available to develop
the product.  All references to sub-tasks within the documents should
be considered obsolete.

Page~1, paragraph~4 states that the duration of a task will be printed
on the PERT charts that are viewable in the program.  This is not the
case.  Only the task number, name, and planned start and end dates are
printed.  There is also a statement about being able to double-click
on a PERT chart box to get the information for that task.  This is not supported.

Similar to what is said in paragraph~4, paragraph~5 contains a line
which reads, ``The user will have the ability to select a task from
the Gantt chart which will cause the task information screen to be
displayed with information on that task.'', which is also not
supported at this time.
