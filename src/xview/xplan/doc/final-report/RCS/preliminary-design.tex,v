@\section{Preliminary Design}

On page~4 subtasks are mentioned.  They were never implemented.  This
was due to the complexity and time given.

On page~8 we mention a write-data-to-file routine.  It is now called
write-file-init.  Also, write-format is now write-file, and
read-data-from-file is read-file.

\subsection{Project File Grammar}

On pages~16 and 17 a grammar is specified for the format of project
files.  The correct and most current reference for this grammar is in
the new version of the user manual, contained in
appendix\ref{user-man} in this document.
