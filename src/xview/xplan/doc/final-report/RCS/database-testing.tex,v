	\item[{Test Data: }]        Before integration with the graphical
                                    user interface, a driver program was
                                    written in stages to white box and
                                    black box test each function of the
                                    database module.  The driver program
                                    was the primary source of debugging
                                    the database module.  After the
                                    database was integrated with the GUI
                                    and ASCII text file input modules, 
                                    simulated user interaction with the GUI
                                    was used to test the database.  Several
                                    xplan project files were created to
                                    fully black box test the database. 
	\item[{Expected Results: }] The database was expected to perform as
                                    it was designed.  After debugging, and
                                    refining the design and code implementation
                                    of the database, the database functions
                                    were tested first by a driver program,
                                    then by the simulated user interaction
                                    with the graphical user interface 
                                    controlling the database.
	\item[{Actual Results: }]   The database performed as was expected
                                    after the debugging process of the code
                                    was finished.  Only one minor error was
                                    encountered which was not corrected in
                                    the final version of xplan. Other errors 
                                    which the database testing driver program
                                    uncovered were errors like C code syntax,
                                    inconsistent variable naming and usage,
                                    and design errors regarding pointer usage.
                                    The known xplan database error is described
                                    in the section explaining database errors 
                                    of this document.
