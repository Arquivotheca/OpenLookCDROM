% The following subsubsection should be repeated for each module that
% is invoked by the top-level module.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Unit tests for Date Arithmetic module} 

This module will calculate the earliest/latest start/end dates. 
Previously, this module was part of General Calculation module. The separation 
was done to simplify the testing procedure. Since this module depend on 
a correct critical path, we must ensure first that the critical path 
calculation will produce a correct result. This way, Date Arithmetic module 
can be tested after the output from General Calculation module has been 
verified.

\begin{description}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Describe the test for the module.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf Description of test for Date Arithmetic module:}] \hfill \\

The test case must ensure that the routines will detect illegal dates
(such as February 30), and that the routines will correctly calculate
the earliest/latest start/end dates, given that the longest path (critical
path) is known. Therefore, the output from this module will depend on the
output generated by General Calculation module. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Use of stubs or other software to facilitate the test
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf Overhead software description:}] \hfill \\

A ``dummy'' database will be used to hold the different sets of test data. 


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% What data did you use to conduct the tests?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf Test case data:}] \hfill \\
Test case data that will be used for Date Arithmetic module are as
follow:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Milestone or deliverable dates
	These dates belong to tasks that have a duration of 0 day. This will
check whether the module correctly take into account those tasks with no
duration.
	\item Multiple critical paths
	Since the algorithm used for calculating the dates rely heavily on
the critical path, this test will check whether the routine still produce a
correct output independent of the critical path chosen by General Calculation
module.
	\item Task duration greater than 1 month
	This will check whether the module perform the date conversion correctly.
Test case should be done especially with the month of February to ensure that
the module will work with any given month.
	\item Task duration greater than 1 year
	Although this is highly unrecommended (to have task duration more than
one year), the test case is useful for checking whether the module calculate
the leap year conversion correctly. This will also have an effect on the month
of February.
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Briefly, what type of results do you expect?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{Expected Results:}] \hfill \\

The module is expected to produce the correct output given the test cases 
above. The output must then be stored to the database at the correct
location.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% DO NOT FILL OUT THE FOLLOWING SECTION FOR THE TESTING SPEC DELIVERABLE!!
% The testing results will be turned when the practice demo is given.
%
% For each top level module, describe the testing results.
