% The following subsubsection should be repeated for each module that
% is invoked by the top-level module.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Unit tests for Gantt Calculation module} 

This module will generate the position of each Gantt bar along with the 
length of the bar.

\begin{description}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Describe the test for the module.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf Description of test for Gantt Calculation module:}] \hfill \\
The test must ensure that each bar is positioned on separate line and length of
the bar must correspond to the task duration. The Gantt bars also must be
displayed in semi-chronological order, meaning that the subtasks within a
task will be displayed in chronological order. See Figure~\ref{order:gantt}.
Notice that sub-task 1.4 and sub-task 2.1 are not in chronological order.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Use of stubs or other software to facilitate the test
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf Overhead software description:}] \hfill \\

This module will use both the ``dummy'' database described earlier in
General Calculation section, and the output generated by MS-project.
Again, since this module is tested independent of \LaTeX\ Gantt Generation
module, the output generated must be compared with the ``paper and pencil''
result.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% What data did you use to conduct the tests?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf Test case data:}] \hfill \\

In addition to the test cases generated for the General Calculation module,
Gantt Calculation module will also use the following test cases:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Task with duration = 0 day (milestones or deliverables)
	\item Overlapping sub-tasks \\
	These are sub-tasks that can start while other sub-tasks (within a
task) have not been completed. 
	\item Insert the tasks in reverse chronological order
	This will ensure that the outputs generated by the Gantt Calculation
module are independent of the order of tasks insertion into the database.
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Briefly, what type of results do you expect?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{Expected Results:}] \hfill \

The expected result is that each bar in the Gantt chart will match the output
produce by the ``paper and pencil'' technique. Note that Gantt Calculation
module only calculates the {\em position and length} of each bar and does not
produce any screen or hard copy output. Therefore, if the result produced by
this module matches the ``paper and pencil'' output, the graph produced by
the ``paper and pencil'' technique will be compared later with the actual
output from MS-Project.

\end{description}
