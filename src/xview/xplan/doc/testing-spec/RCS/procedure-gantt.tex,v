\section{Test Procedure for the LaTeX Gantt Chart Generation Module}
  The testing for the modules that consist of the Gantt chart
Generation Modules will start from the generate-gantt-chart module.
Here the module will test the calls to the get-gantt-formatting-info
module, the split-gantt-chart-into-pages, the file-open module, the
generate-gantt-page, and the file-close module. These function calls
will be made with stubs in there place to simulate the call. The
parameters sent will be printed in the stubs. The next module that
will be tested is the split-gantt-chart-into-pages. the module
split-gantt-chart-into-pages will figure out how the pages will set up
for in the latex file. The function, generate-gantt-page, will involve
making the calls to the functions that will create the latex commands
for the Gantt chart. This function will be tested with stubs in place of
the calls to the generate-gantt-bar and generate-dependency-lines modules.
Lastly, the function that writes the latex commands to the latex file
for a gantt bar generate-gantt-bar will be tested by creating a latex
file. This file will be LaTeX, printed, and inspected to insure the
correctness of the bar.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% For each top level module:
%
%	0. Describe the top level module
%
%	1. List the low-level modules that are invoked by the
% 	top level module
%
%	2. Discuss integration provisions and outline integration tests
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Order of integration}
 In integrating these modules, the database, read-file, and interface
must be coded and tested in order for the calculations section to
accurately produce the chart dimensions and dependencies as expressed
in the calculations functions, generate-dependency-lines and
get-gantt-formatting-info. Once this process is done, the modules tested
will involve the lowest level modules within the LaTeX Gantt Chart
Generation Modules. The first of these modules will be the
generate-gantt-bar module which creates the commands for a bar within
the LaTeX file. The next module that will be tested will be the
generate-gantt-page to create a Gantt chart page.
Split-gantt-chart-into-pages will be the next module that will be
tested because it used the two lower level modules. The
generate-gantt-chart module will be the last module that will be tested
since it will use all of the lower level modules and the modules from
the database.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Describe (briefly) the modules that are to be tested.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Modules to be tested}
The modules that will be tested include generate-gantt-chart,
split-gantt-chart-into-pages, generate-gantt-page, and
generate-gantt-bar.

\subsubsection{Unit tests for module generate-gantt-page} 
\begin{description}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Describe the test for the module.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf Description of test for module generate-gantt-page:}] \hfill \\
  This module will generate the page associated with the particular
part of the gantt chart. Only the gantt bars and tasks that fit on the
specified page will be generated.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Use of stubs or other software to facilitate the test
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf Overhead software description:}] \hfill \\
A driver will be needed for testing this function. It will be used
with user input parameters from the call of the driver. The input used
by the driver will be created by the driver.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% What data did you use to conduct the tests?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf Test case data:}] \hfill \\
All cases will involve the driver calling the function with random
test data as its parameters. Each test case will in involve the
creation of a LaTeX file.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Briefly, what type of results do you expect?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{Expected Results:}] \hfill \\
The .dvi file will be created from the use of the LaTeX command, and
the bars and task names on the page are in the proper positions  as
specified by the input data from the driver program.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Unit tests for module split-gantt-chart-into-pages} 
\begin{description}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Describe the test for the module.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf Description of test for module split-gantt-chart-into-pages:}] \hfill \\
This module will determine the amount of pages that the Gantt chart
will need. It will receive the task-list and will return the the
matrix-of-task-lists and the pages-across to the caller.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Use of stubs or other software to facilitate the test
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf Overhead software description:}] \hfill \\
A driver program will be used in the testing of this module. The
database, read-file, and user interface must be in working order for
this phase of testing. The task-list received by the function will be
the determining factor as to the amount of pages that will be
necessary.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% What data did you use to conduct the tests?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf Test case data:}] \hfill \\
All tests will involve the use of a generated task list from the
database modules. From the data given through the task list, the amount
of Gantt bars will be calculated which then the number of pages can be
calculated. The tasks will be entered from the user interface into the
database or read in from an existing file.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Briefly, what type of results do you expect?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{Expected Results:}] \hfill \\
From the number of tasks and dependencies that are given, the number
of pages will be determined.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf Overhead software description:}] \hfill \\
  The overhead software used in this module will consist of all of the
other functions used in the Gantt Chart Generation Module with the user
interface calling this function.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% What data did you use to conduct the tests?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{\bf Test case data:}] \hfill \\
The test of this routine will involve inputs of the task information
from the user interface to the database and creating the LaTeX output.
The parameters from the calls that are made within the module will be
displayed to test the correctness of the call.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Briefly, what type of results do you expect?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item[{Expected Results:}] \hfill \\
The results from the first case will be check from the output from the
MS-Projects to see if the charts are accurate. These LaTeX outputs
will correspond to the task list that was input by the user.
The second case will display the correct information generated by the
function of the parameters from the called function.
