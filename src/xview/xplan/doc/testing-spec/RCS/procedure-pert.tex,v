\section{Test Procedure for the \LaTeX\ PERT Chart Generation Module}
The testing of the PERT Chart Generation Modules begins with the
generate-pert-chart module.  Here the module will test the calls to
the get-pert-formatting-info module, the split-pert-chart-into-pages,
the file-open module, the generate-pert-page, and the file-close
module. These function calls will be made with stubs in their place to
simulate the call. The parameters sent will be printed in the stubs.
The next module that will be tested is the
split-pert-chart-into-pages. The module split-pert-chart-into-pages
will figure out how the pages will set up for in the \LaTeX\ file. The
function generate-pert-page will involve making the calls to the
functions that will create the \LaTeX\ commands for the PERT chart. This
function will be tested with stubs in place of the calls to the
generate-pert-box and generate-dependency-lines modules.  Finally, the
function that writes the \LaTeX\ commands to the \LaTeX\ file for a pert
box generate-pert-box will be tested by creating a \LaTeX\ file. This
file will be \LaTeX\, printed, and inspected to insure the correctness
of the box.

% For each top level module:
%
%	0. Describe the top level module
%
%	1. List the low-level modules that are invoked by the

%
%	2. Discuss integration provisions and outline integration tests
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Order of integration}
 In integrating these modules, the database, read-file, and interface
must be coded and tested in order for the calculations section to
accurately produce the chart dimensions and dependencies as expressed
in the calculations functions generate-dependency-lines and
get-pert-formatting-info. Once this process is done, the modules tested
will involve the lowest level modules of the \LaTeX\ PERT Chart
Generation Modules. The first of these modules will be the
generate-pert-box module which creates the commands for a box within
the \LaTeX\ file. The next module that will be tested will be the
generate-pert-page because this module used the module generate-pert-box.
Split-pert-chart-into-pages will be the next module that will be
tested because it used the two lower level modules. The
generate-pert-chart module will be the last module that will be tested
since it will use all of the lower level modules and the modules from
the database.

Here the module will test the calls to the get-pert-formatting-info
module, the split-pert-chart-into-pages, the file-open module, the
generate-pert-page, and the file-close module. These function calls
will be made with stubs in there place to simulate the call. The
parameters sent will be printed in the stubs. The next module that
will be tested is the split-pert-chart-into-pages. the module
split-pert-chart-into-pages will figure out how the pages will set up

making the calls to the functions that will create the latex commands
for the PERT chart. This function will be tested with stubs in place of
the calls to the generate-pert-box and generate-dependency-lines modules.
Lastly, the function that writes the latex commands to the latex file
for a pert box generate-pert-box will be tested by creating a latex
