\paragraph{Write File module}


  There has been a slight deviation in the write-file module, since
the write-file module is recursive, a write-file-setup module must be
present to retrieve the filename and the top of the main task list.
The call to write-file will only have the parameter of a pointer taat
points to the top of the main task list. If the file is unsuccessful
at the time of the open statement an error will be sent back to the
caller. 

  The write-file module will traverse through the main task list and
printout all of the tasks and that tasks subtasks until the routine
reaches a null pointer to a main task list. This module will create
two task list pointers, one to keep track of the main task list that
the function is currently on and the other to go through the subtasks
of the task list that the function is currently on. There will be a
function that will get the filename from the user interface and will
set up the file pointer to point to the top of the main task list.
From here there will be a cell to implememt the recursive write-file
function. The function will only call itself if there are subtasks
within the task that it is currently on. When the write-file goes into
a recursive state, there are subtasks in the task, the function will
be called with the pointer of the subtask list. This process will
happen until the subtask list is exhausted. At this point, both of the
temperary pointers will point to the next task in the main list.

  The only module that will be called from the write-file modules is
the get-main-task-list function which returns the pointer to the top
of the main task list.

  The integration of this module will depend on the database
being in working order and that the user interface has made retrieved
the filename from the user and has made the call to the write-file-setup
module with that filename.
