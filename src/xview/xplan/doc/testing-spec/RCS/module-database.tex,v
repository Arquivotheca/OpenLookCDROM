\section{Database Module Test Procedure}

  To fully test the database module for xplan, bottom up testing for the database
module and white box testing of all supporting  unit functions will be performed to
test the logic, data structures, boundaries, and interfaces.  A driver program will be written
in ANSI C to perform black box testing of the entire database module.  Since the
xplan database is more of a data structure than a large scale database, only one
driver program will be necessary for testing.  The driver program will test all
unit functions by either calling them directly, or indirectly through the use of 
other unit functions for the database module.  The driver program will call
all functions which create, edit, search, and destroy a PERT/Gantt Chart project
task list.  Once the black box testing with the driver program is complete, the
database module will be fully integrated with the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
module.  The GUI will then be used to further black box test the database, since
the database is designed to be called by the GUI\@@.  Next, the ASCII text file
input module will be integrated with the GUI and database modules to test the
full design of the database as described in the xplan software detailed design
document.  Since the database only outputs a pointer to a task, or task list
to the PERT/Gantt Chart critical path calculations module, only integration 
testing will be necessary at that point.  The database testing is rather straight
forward.  The task list information is either processed correctly or with error.
If errors such as syntax, logic, or local and global data usage are found, the
database module and supporting functional units will be edited and revised as 
necessary.  Since a hash table is maintained by the database to store all of the
task resources for the xplan  PERT/Gantt Chart project, the functions implementing
the hash table will also be tested by the driver program.  Finally, a review of the
data base implementation will be done by group members by doing a code walk through
as a second check on the testing process.

  For the database test driver program, arbitrary sample  test data will be generated to
test the database module and its supporting functional units.  Each unit is
expected to perform the way its name implies, and the way it was described 
in the xplan detailed design document.  The types of test data used to test the
functions of the database submodule areas  will always be the same  since only one driver
program will be written to test the Database before it is integrated with the GUI module. 
Of course, only data relevant to a module will be called by its interface.  Global
variables and constants will be simulated with assigned values in the database driver
test program.  The different type of test data for the Database module and submodule areas
are the following.  For bottom up testing, arbitrary data to simulate tasks will be
generated to be input to the driver program to call and test the task list and
information creation, destruction, editing and searching modules. Once that
test is satisfied, some simple data representing a real task will be used with
the driver program to test the integrity of the database module and its 
supporting submodule areas  and unit functions.  Basically, that is to test that
editing of the xplan database occurs properly and does not inadvertently change other
data. 

   Finally, the ultimate test case will be the input of PERT/Gantt chart data into the finished
fully integrated xplan system software, which our group provided with MS Project for our
Project Plan document. Although that is to primarily test the entire xplan system, it will
be useful for black box testing the database module since it is a large data set, 
with specific information which must be processed correctly.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Database Module Order of Integration}

   When testing the database module, all supporting functional units will be
integrated at the same time in the database test driver program. That is because
the database is really a data structure which calls functions in the basic
areas of creation, destruction, editing, and searching a task list.  Furthermore,
basic hash table functions are used for a hashing method with a collision resolution
method of linear chaining.  It would not be reasonable to test only one function at
a time with a driver program, because the code is very small for the database module's
unit functions.

\paragraph{Database Module Test Purpose}

    The database module and its supporting functional units will be fully tested and
evaluated for performance. Once the database module correctly creates, edits, and maintains
task lists of information for PERT/Gantt chart generation, it will be integrated with
the GUI, ASCII text file input, and Calculations modules of xplan.  The
purpose of testing the database is to insure that the database unit functions for PERT/Gantt chart
task list creation and management operate correctly as specified in the detailed design document. 
Furthermore, the test program will focus on the issues of interface integrity, functional
validity, and information content.  Basically, internal and external interfaces are tested
as each function of the Database module is integrated into it, tests will look for and
be design to discover functional, logical, design, boundary, and interface types of errors in the
Database modules functions.  Also,  testing will focus on the usage of global and
local variables called and used by the Database module and supporting functions, to
insure their correct usage and calling, as well as their consistency with the xplan
data dictionary that was described in the Detailed Design document and is revised as necessary.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Describe (briefly) the modules that are to be tested.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Database Modules to be tested}

    Main submodule areas  requiring testing for the data base are: Task List Creation,
Task List Removal, Task List Editing, Task List Searching for a particular 
Task, Hash Table functions used to store all of the resources data for an
entire xplan PERT/Gantt chart project.  Although there are no specific submodules
with the above names, functional units for the database may be grouped together in
the above general areas for database operations tested in the database test driver
program.  The functions called and used by the Task List Creation submodule area are:
create-task-info, create-task-node, create-task-list, create-resource-info,
string-hash-insert. The functions called and used by the Task List Removal submodule
area are: destroy-task-info, destroy-resource-info. The functions called for
Task List Editing and  Task List  Searching submodule areas are the same.  The 
difference is that Searching only returns a pointer to a task list, or a task, and
Editing allows the fields of a task node to be modified.  Functions supporting
those submodule areas  are: add-task-to-beginning, add-task-to-end, add-task-before,
add-task-after, find-task, list-current, list-next, string-hash-search,
get-main-task-list. The unit test information for the above submodule areas  will
be given now.
