The documentation contained in this directory was all written with
LaTeX, and contains over 300 printed pages.  Included are:

	Weekly Status Reports
	Project Plan
	Requirements Specification
	Preliminary Design
	Detailed Design
	Top-Level Code
	Testing Specification
	User's Manual
	Presentation Materials
	Final Report (with updated user's manual).

The user's manual to look at is the one included in the final report.
I have a feeling there may be a missing .rs or .fig file here or there
(I'm not sure, but some omission of that sort might have occured.  In
any event, we all hope you find xplan useful and can extend it in ways
that are helpful to you.
