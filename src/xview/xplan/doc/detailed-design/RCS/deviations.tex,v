\section{Deviations}

Some deviations of context from the previous documents are that the
grammar for reading in the file has been changed and the main data
structure of the tool (the task-list) has been modified to accommodate
the implementation of the program. Other changes are that the latex
generator has been broken up into two different modules, the write
function has been converted into one module, the calculations module
is broken down into two modules. The program will be using a hash
table to store the resources so that they will only be used once.
