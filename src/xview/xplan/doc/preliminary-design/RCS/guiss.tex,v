%% SUBSECTION FOR GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE SUBSYSTEM
%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%===========================================================================
\subsection{Graphical User Interface Subsystem}

%%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%% SUBSUBSECTION FOR PROCESSING NARRATIVE
%%%
%%% For the preliminary design, make the processing narrative
%%% only textual. In the Detailed design, you will provide a
%%% structural description.
%%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Processing Narrative}

The graphical user interface (GUI) will process interactive user
requests that are activated using the keyboard and mouse.  The
interface itself has a main screen, the \pscreen, which is used along
with the \tiscreen\/ throughout the entire task entry process.

There are items available on the \pscreen\/ menus to load and save
files, generate PERT and Gantt charts, analyze the task network, and
export the task list to a \LaTeX\ file.

All processing happens as a result of callbacks to functions
originally created by the Sun OpenWindows Developer Guide, and
subsequently modified by our development team.  The callbacks are
invoked based upon user input.

%%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%% SUBSUBSECTION FOR INTERFACE DESCRIPTION
%%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Interface Description}

The GUI interfaces with the rest of the project planning tool via the
callbacks previously mentioned.  Each callback will have code that
calls functions in the database and calculations subsystems.
Specifically within the database subsystem, the modules whose purpose
is to create, store, retrieve, and delete data will be called.  The
calculation subsystem will be called to retrieve data used in the
graphical display of PERT and Gantt charts.

%%%
%%%	The following section will be filled in during the detailed design
%%%	phase. For now, it is commented out.
%%%
%%%	\subsection{Design Language Description}

%%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%% SUBSUBSECTION FOR MODULES USED
%%%
%%% Identify the modules to be used by different modules
%%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%%===========================================================================
\subsubsection{Modules Used}

Each of the callbacks will be used by a specific module as its means
of communicating with the user.  However, the callbacks will never be
called directly  by another part of the system.  Instead, when a
callback is invoked based upon user interaction, that callback will
call appropriate modules within other subsystems to perform the
necessary action associated with the user's input.

%%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%% SUBSUBSECTION FOR DATA ORGANIZATION
%%%
%%% Describe the data structures to be used for the software.
%%% Give their organization.
%%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Data Organization}

The graphical user interface will use local scalar data, and in
addition make use of the task list that is maintained by the database
subsystem.  Much of the access to the task list will happen indirectly
through calls to the database subsystem modules.

%%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%% SUBSUBSECTION FOR COMMENTS
%%%
%%% Create the skeleton for each of the modules by commenting
%%% the purpose of each.
%%%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Comments}

Due to the nature of the graphical user interface, and its many simple
callbacks which are generated automatically by Guide, specific
comments on each will not be provided at this time.
