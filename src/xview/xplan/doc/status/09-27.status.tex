\section{Issues}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Project plan template was not clear in certain areas ---
	we were not sure how much detail we needed to go into on the
	PERT and Gantt charts.

	\item Without doing a large portion of design, we cannot
	determine who will be working on each portion of the
	final product.

	\item It would be nice to have all of the templates available
	to us so we can get a better idea of the ``big picture'' of
	where we are headed, and plan out the amount of time each task
	will take.
\end{itemize}
