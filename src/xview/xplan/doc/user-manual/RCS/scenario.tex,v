\section{User Scenarios}

In xplan's main window labeled ``xplan'' the task names for a project
are listed in a scrolling list.  If you loaded the file from disk (by
selecting the Load option from the File Menu), you will see task names
listed.  If you are starting from scratch (by selecting the New
Project option from the File Menu), you will be given an empty
scrolling list.  In order to input task information into the system,
click on the Insert Menu and select either ``Before'', ``After'',
``Top'' or ``Bottom''.

Whenever a task's information is to be created or edited by the GUI, a
popup window labeled ``Task Information'' will appear with all of the
task related information described in the Functionality Description
section of this document.  For items such as task name, task
description, task options, task dates, and task times, you may
directly type in this popup window. See Figure
~\ref{projdesc:taskinfo}.

		\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\centerline{\psfig{figure=proj-des-task-info.ps,height=4in}}
		\caption[Project Description Task Info]{Task Information for 
			Project Description.}
		\label{projdesc:taskinfo}
		\end{figure}

To display and edit Task Dependencies and Task Resources Lists, you
click the left button of the mouse on the control buttons labeled
``Dependencies'' and ``Resources'' in the ``Task Information'' window.
When you click on the ``Resources'' control button, a popup window
like the one in Figure~\ref{resources:win} will appear.  Similarly, if
you click on the ``Dependencies'' button, a window like the one in
Figure~\ref{dependency:win} will appear.

		\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\centerline{\psfig{figure=resources.ps,height=3in}}
		\caption[Resources pop-up window]{Resources pop-up window.}
		\label{resources:win}
		\end{figure}

		\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\centerline{\psfig{figure=dependency.ps,height=3in}}
		\caption[Dependency pop-up window]{Dependency pop-up window.}
		\label{dependency:win}
		\end{figure}

After you have finished creating or editing a task, you must decide if
you want to save that tasks new information.  Pressing the left button
of the mouse on the ``Apply'' button of the Task Information popup
window will save the new task, or changes made to an old task's
information.  Pressing the left button of the mouse on the ``Reset''
button will cancel the changes made to an existing task, or not create
the new task.

Suppose that you have added three tasks to your project. The main
xplan window will look something like Figure~\ref{3:tasks}.

		\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\centerline{\psfig{figure=3tasks.ps,height=3in}}
		\caption[Xplan Main Window]{An example of xplan main window
			with three tasks in it.}
		\label{3:tasks}
		\end{figure}

Now you can display the resulting PERT and Gantt charts by selecting
the corresponding options on Chart Menu. The PERT chart will look like
Figure~\ref{pert:chart}, while the Gantt chart will look like
Figure~\ref{gantt:chart}.

		\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\centerline{\psfig{figure=test_pert.ps,width=4in}}
		\caption[PERT Chart]{An example of a PERT chart.}
		\label{pert:chart}
		\end{figure}

		\begin{figure}
		\centering
		\centerline{\psfig{figure=test_gantt.ps,width=4in}}
		\caption[Gantt Chart]{An example of a Gantt chart.}
		\label{gantt:chart}
		\end{figure}

These windows operations are self-explanatory for the user who is
familiar with using graphical user interfaces (GUI) designed for
software running in an X Windows environment.  However, if you need
help while running xplan in real time, you may use the help facilities
provided by the GUI.  If are using the Sun SPARCstation 1 or 2, press
the ``Help'' key and use the mouse to select the item you are
interested in being helped with.  The GUI and online help capabilities
for xplan were developed with OpenWindows Developer's Guide 3.0 for
use on a Sun SPARCstation.  If you are not using a Sun SPARCstation,
you will need to consult you workstation's manual for how to utilize
the equivalent of the ``Help'' key present on Sun keyboards.

For additional help, this manual is included in the xplan delivery
package of a compressed tar file.  This manual is provided in
PostScript format for the user to view either online, or generate a
hard copy by using a PostScript laser printer.

After you have created a project task list in xplan for your project
and viewed the PERT/Gantt charts, you may save your work to ASCII text
file format for further xplan processing at a later date, or to the
\LaTeX\ file format for incorporating PERT charts, Gantt charts, and
Task Sheet into professional quality documents.  Those documents
regarding your project may then be put into PostScript format for
electronic distribution on computer networks and the Internet, or
laser printed in a hard copy format to paper or overhead slides for
presentations.  We recommend that the user obtain \cite{latex-manual}
if unfamiliar with \LaTeX\.  Since \LaTeX\ is also provided as
freeware, the budget conscious user can productively utilize the
xplan software by using it in conjunction with \LaTeX\ as part of a
total document processing system for generating reports and
information regarding the status of the project being managed.

In the xplan softwares main menu labeled ``xplan'' the task names for
a project are listed in the textpane control window with the vertical
scroll bar underneath the four control buttons. If you selected an
ASCII text format input file (by selecting the Load option from the
File Menu), you will see task names listed.  If you are starting from
scratch (by selecting the New Project option from the File Menu), you
will be given a blank text pane. To input task information into a
blank textpane on the ``xplan'' window, click on the Insert Menu. You
can insert a new task to a location specified by either one of the
four Insert Menu choices.
%you must click the right mouse button in the ``Tasks'' textpane to see the
%popup window labeled ``Scrolling List''.  If you select the ``Locate
%Choice'' option, you may search for a particular task in the main task
%list for your project which xplan is calculating PERT/Gantt charts
%for.  If you select the ``Edit List'' option, you may change, or
%delete an existing task you click on with the mouse button to
%high-light in the ``Tasks'' textpane.  If you select the ``Insert''
%option of the ``Scrolling List'' popup window's ``Edit List'' popup
%window, you may enter a new task into xplan's database for your
%project.
