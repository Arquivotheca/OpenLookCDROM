\section{Installation Procedure}
\label{sec:install}

Before trying to install xplan, please read sections \ref{hw-req} and
\ref{sw-req} which discuss the hardware and software requirements of
xplan.  If your system does not meet these requirements, it is
possible that you will not be able to build xplan without first making
modifications to it.

xplan is distributed in a compressed tar file format, and can be
received from various anonymous ftp sites.  Once received, you should
run {\tt uncompress} on the tar file to de-compress it.  Then, {\tt
tar xvf filename} (where {\tt filename} is the name of the tar file)
should be used to un-tar the contents of the archive.  Once this has
been done, the user will have an {\tt xplan} directory in which the
source files will be located.  Next the user should enter the {\tt
xplan} directory and run {\tt make} to build the program.  If any
compilation errors occur (which might happen if the user is trying to
build the program in an environment different than the one it was
developed in) the user will have to determine what the problem is and
take action to correct it.

At this point the program has been installed and should run without
error.  To begin xplan, the user types {\tt xplan} at the command
prompt.

The installation procedure for xplan is the following.  First, please
note that xplan is distributed in a compressed tar file format via the
Internet community and anonymous ftp sites.  Once you find the
location of the xplan distribution file, ftp it to your machine
operating with a Unix and X Windows environment capability.
Uncompress and extract the distribution file in the directory you
create for running xplan.  Execute the makefile for xplan, and then
type ``xplan'' after compilation on your machine is successful.  You
are now ready to run xplan and create PERT/Gantt charts for managing
your projects.  If you have LaTeX installed, you may output the
PERT/Gantt charts to the LaTeX file format for document processing
with LaTeX.  Note that your system must have the gcc ANSI C compiler,
Unix, X Windows, and the X libraries for successful compilation of the
xplan software.  You may input and output ASCII text files to xplan
via the GUI once you are running xplan.
