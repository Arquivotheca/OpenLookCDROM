In the two subdirectories are the sources for libguide.a and
libguidexv.a for Devguide version 3.0.1.

To compile them read the accompaning README.linux files.

In the original distribution from SUN there are sources for
another library: libgolit.a. It cannot compiled on a Linux
system, because you will need the OLIT-libraries and header
files for it.
