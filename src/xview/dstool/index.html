Dstool: A Dynamical System with an Interactive Graphical Interface
</H1>
<P>
To quote from the authors' documentation:
<QP>
A dynamical system is defined by a set of rules or transformations for
determining how points in a multidimensional space move in time. Time
may either be discrete or continuous.  The traces of the points as
they move in discrete or continuous time are called trajectories. The
goal of dynamical systems theory is to provide a comprehensive
description of the geometric structures arising from these trajectories.

<P>If that makes sense to you, this may be the program for you.
Or, if you want to see some neat graphics, look at the Tutorial document.
