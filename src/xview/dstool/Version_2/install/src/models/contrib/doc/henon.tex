\section{Complex H\'{e}non Mapping}

The complex H\'{e}non map is a family of quadratic diffeomorphisms of $C^2$
defined by
\[
\left( \begin{array}{c} x \\ y \end{array} \right)
\rightarrow \left( \begin{array}{c} x^2+c-ay \\ x \end{array} \right)
\]
where $a,c\in C$.  These mappings are fundamental to the study of
polynomial diffeomorphisms of $C^2$ and is a complex generalization
of the H\'{e}non family of mappings defined on the plane 
$(x,y,a,c\in R)$ \cite{Henon:mapping}.

The real family exhibits strange attractors in a persistent way which is related
to the unfolding of a homoclinic tangency and has been the subject of
much research \cite{BC,MoraViana:abundance}.
The file {\tt henon1.dat} contains parameter values for which a strange attractor
exists on the real subspace.
