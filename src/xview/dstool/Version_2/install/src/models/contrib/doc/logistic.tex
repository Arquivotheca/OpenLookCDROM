\section{The Logistic Map}

The logistic map is a one-dimensional, one-parameter
mapping given by the following equation:
\[
	x \rightarrow \mu x (1-x)
\]
This mapping is a paradigm for the cascade of period
doubling bifurcations.  The text by Devaney \cite{Devaney} is a
good introductory reference.

The file {\tt logistic1.dat} contains initial conditions for creating
the period doubling bifurcation diagram.  Simply load the
file and press FORWARDS on the Multiple Orbits Panel.
