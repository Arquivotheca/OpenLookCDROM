For version 1.1, there have been some small changes in user dstool 
configurations. 

Users of version 1.0 who install their own models have a local directory,
<personal-dstool> (often $HOME/dstool) for their customized configurations.
The directory <personal-dstool> has two subdirectories, "models", and
"userlib". 

Under version 1.0, when installing a model in the file <model_def>, users 
added lines to the files 
	<personal-dstool>/models/Makefile
	<personal-dstool>/models/modellib_ds_def.h
as well as creating the file <model_def> by editing 	
	<personal-dstool>/models/GENERIC.c.

Under version 1.1, several Makefiles have changed, the file
"modellib_ds_def.h" has been replaced by "modellib_ds_def.c" and
the header files included in each model file have changed slightly.

We're sorry users have to make changes in upgrading. The changes 
advance dstool portability, and will be of further aid in 
future releases.

To upgrade, we suggest the following:

	a) Create a new user dstool subdirectory <new_personal_directory>,
	e.g. $HOME/dstool_1.1. Let <old_personal_directory> be
	your previous user dstool subdirectory, e.g. $HOME/dstool.

	b) Be sure your DSTOOL environment variable is set to the
	new central dstool_1.1 source directory, e.g. /usr/local/dstool_1.1.
	If you use the now optional DSTOOL_COLOR_DIR environment variable,
	set it to $DSTOOL/colormaps.

	c) Type:
		$DSTOOL/bin/install_dsuser
	
	d) Answer the question about "user-dstool directory" by
	specifying the full pathname (no environment variables or
	other csh abbreviations) of <new_personal_directory>.

	e) For each new model you installed in <old_personal_directory>/models,
	copy it to <new_personal_directory>/models.

	f) cd <new_personal_directory>/models

	g) Invoke the script "update_model" (or $DSTOOL/bin/update_model)
	on each of the files you copied in step e). (Typing 
	"update_model *.c" is a safe shortcut.)

	h) Edit the file modellib_ds_def.c. For each model menu entry
	you added in <old_personal_directory>/models/modellib_ds_def.h,
	copy the line to <new_personal_directory>/models/modellib_ds_def.c.
		( e.g. for your additional models, copy lines like
			{ 1, "Lorenz System", lorenz_init } 
		  in the initialization of 
			struct	DS_DataS	DS_Sel[] =
		)

	i) Edit the SOURCES_B line in <new_personal_directory>/models/Makefile 
	to include each model source file which you have added.

You should now be all set. Assuming the environment variables DSTOOL,
OPENWINHOME, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH are properly set, changing to 
<new_personal_directory> and typing "make" should compile an updated 
customized "dstool_u".
