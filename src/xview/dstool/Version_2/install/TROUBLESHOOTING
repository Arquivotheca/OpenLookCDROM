Problems:

The script install_dstool in $DSTOOL/bin may be rerun if problems
arise. 

By default, the install script changes the protection on ordinary files
to 444, thereby preventing accidental overwriting. When this gets in the way,
do:
		cd $DSTOOL
		chmod -R u+w .

Should problems arise in this script, after unpacking, installation
can usually be completed by the sequence of steps
	cd $DSTOOL/src
	make dstool
	make dslibs
	make dstool_nowin

The file $DSTOOL/site_specific/lib_incl.mk is included and
critical in most Makefiles. In particular, commenting out of
the macros "USING_FORTRAN", "USING_TCL", and "USING_PVM" in
that file controls whether files using those optional
resources are linked into the final executable.

If your operating system is Sun OS 4, Sun OS 5, Irix 5, or Linux,
then the install_dstool script copies lib_incl.mk and the *target.mk*
files from a subdirectory of $DSTOOL/site_specific/arch.

The file $DSTOOL/site_specific/DEPENDENCIES lists xview and X
files (libraries and include) which are needed in compilation.
These are available during operating system installation
on Sun systems but may not be present because they of lack of selection
installation time.

For non-Sun systems, xview will have to be acquired from public
domain sources.
