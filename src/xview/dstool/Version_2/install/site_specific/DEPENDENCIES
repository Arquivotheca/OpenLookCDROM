Libraries used by dstool in Version 1.1
***************************************
In addition to "libm" and other normal C libraries, the dstool Makefiles
expect the following libraries to be in the directory $OPENWINHOME/lib:

	libolgx.so
	libxview.so
	libX11.so	(pointed to by libX.so) 

If, for example, your X installation does not contain libX11.so 
in the same directory as libxview.so, you may wish to do one of the following:

	a) Edit the file $DSTOOL/site_specific/lib_incl.mk to add additional
	"-L" entries to LDLIBS.

	b) Add symbolic links to your normal xview library location.

	c) Create a new directory with subdirectories include and lib.
	Set OPENWINHOME to this directory. Create symbolic links in lib
	to the locations where the above three libraries actually are. Create
	symbolic links in include to the directories where the X11 and
	xview include files are located on your system.



Include files used by dstool in Version 1.1
*******************************************
The following references expect files to be found in the subdirectories 
of $OPENWINHOME/include:
	 <X11/Xatom.h>
	 <X11/Xlib.h>
	 <X11/Xutil.h>
	 <xview/alert.h>
	 <xview/canvas.h>
	 <xview/cms.h>
	 <xview/icon_load.h>
	 <xview/notice.h>
	 <xview/notify.h>
	 <xview/panel.h>
	 <xview/rect.h>
	 <xview/scrollbar.h>
	 <xview/svrimage.h>
	 <xview/termsw.h>
	 <xview/text.h>
	 <xview/textsw.h>
	 <xview/tty.h>
	 <xview/xv_xrect.h>
	 <xview/xview.h>
	 <xview/xview.h> 

The following references expect files to be found in the subdirectories 
of /usr/include:

	 <ctype.h>
	 <setjmp.h>
	 <signal.h>
	 <stddef.h>
	 <stdio.h>
	 <stdlib.h>
	 <string.h>
	 <strings.h>
	 <sys/param.h>
	 <sys/timeb.h>
	 <sys/types.h>
	 <varargs.h>

Other include files are generally found in $DSTOOL/src/include, or other
specific directories of the dstool distribution heirarchy.

If your installation has some of these include files in other 
places (e.g. no $OPENWINHOME/include/X11 subdirectory), you may wish
to edit the CPPFLAGS line of $DSTOOL/site_specific/lib_incl.mk to
add additional "-I" entries.
