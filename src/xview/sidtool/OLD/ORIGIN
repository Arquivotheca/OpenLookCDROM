[[From the author:
This is version 3.0.2 of sidtool (a pacman like game). It's the third major
release of the software. The first two versions were written in SunWindows
(1985) and SunView (1987) respectively for Sun workstations. Sidtool has now
been converted to XView (an X11 toolkit). Although the software has only been
tested on Suns, I hope it should be fairly easy to port to other systems
running Unix, C and XView.
 
See the manual pages or the online help for more details of how to play
the game.
 
See the README file for details of how to compile sidtool.

The graphics user interface has been designed using Suns' devGuide. This
automatically generates the sidtool_ui.c and sidtool_ui.h files, and the
stubs for the notify procedures have been added into the xview.c file. I
can generate stubs and ui files for OLIT and tNt if anybody is interested
in creating versions of sidtool using those toolkits.]]
