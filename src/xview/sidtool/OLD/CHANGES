Sidtool v3.0 change history.
============================

v3.0 - patchlevel 2. 19th August 1991.

  * Forgot to include Makefile.dist in shar #3 or in the MANIFEST and FILES
    files. Tidied up the "make lint" entry in Makefile.dist.

  * Added in hooks for sound.

  * sidtools' canvas is no longer retained by default. Introduced a
    "canpaint" variable which is set when it's okay to draw to the sidtool
    canvas. Added in compression of repaint events. This now gives acceptable
    performance under OpenWindows V2 as well as V3, although it has problems
    still in the initial canvas redraw due to the repaint procedure being
    called twice.

  * Added in a -retained command line option, which cause sidtool to use a
    retained canvas. This improves repainting, and is ideal for people
    running V3, or V2 with a lot of memory. The manual pages have been
    updated accordingly.

  * Added in a -maze command line option. This allows you to specify a
    file containing a new maze layout. Details of how to construct the maze
    are included in the README file and the manual pages.

  * Added in the new copyright messages to the sidtool source files, and
    the online credit and help screens, after discussions with Brad Myers.

  * Added in Brads' address to the README and manual pages.

  * Juggled the files to fit under 60Kbytes per shar. Updated MANIFEST.

  * Posted to comp.sources.games.

v3.0 - patchlevel 1. 12th August 1991.

  * From Jeff Blows <jeffb@Aus.Sun.COM>
    Warp the mouse into the maze when the user presses the "New Game" button.

  * Fruit values were not being updated after clearing a screens worth of
    dots.

  * "Life" screens were not being cleared correctly in the sidtool control
    panel when you loose a life.

  * The joystick direction image (which should be near the top of the maze)
    was not being shown.

  * The scores are correctly blinked when changing players or when a player
    looses a life.

  * When a screens worth of dots was cleared, the "flashing" of the terminal
    screen was too fast.

  * The speed of the game has been tuned. Should run mostly smoothly now.

  * The number of players value on the property sheet was incorrect.

  * On the credits screen, the speed when moving right was incorrect.

  * The "The old record" line is coming up inactive.

  * The following X resources have been added:

      sidtool.players:        1         # Integer: number of players.
      sidtool.skillLevel:     5         # Integer: skill level.
      sidtool.pauseFactor:    20000     # Integer: pause factor.
      sidtool.slugFactor:     5         # Integer: main loop slug factor.

    The manuals pages have been updated to mention these.

  * The following command line options have been added:

      -players players  -  number of players.
      -skill   level    -  skill level.
      -pause   factor   -  pause factor (in microseconds).
      -slug    factor   -  slug factor (in milliseconds).

    Changed the -s command line option to -scorefile.

    The manual pages have been updated to reflect these changes.

  * The users' command line options are now written out correctly after a
    "Save WorkSpace".

  * Described details of how to construct mazes in a comment above the
    default maze in main.c

  * Moved the majority of the #include file to individual source files,
    slightly speeding up the compilation.

  * Linted the code removing unwanted variables and fixing up most
    inconsistencies.

v3.0 - patchlevel 0. 9th August 1991.

  * Made available internally to Sun via anonymous ftp.
