This directory contains the source to xftp/mftp/oftp version 2.1 a
Athena or Athen3d (xftp), Motif (mftp) or Open LOOK (oftp) interface to ftp.

See the file INSTALL for documentation on building moxftp.

This version no longer uses pty's or pipes to talk to ftp.  It should
be a little more portable.  Most of the machine dependent configuration
has been isolated to "machine.h".

The athena version of moxftp will build under X11R6.
