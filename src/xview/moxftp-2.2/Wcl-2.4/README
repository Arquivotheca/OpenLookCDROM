Widget Creation Library Version 2.4 Distribution
------------------------------------------------

The distribution contains files which make up the Widget Creation
Library (Wcl or libWc.a), and resource interpreters and utility
libraries (which include Table widgets) for each of the following
widget sets: Athena, Cornell, Motif, and OpenLook.

Wcl is completely widget set independent.  It provides mechanisms to
allow an entire user interface to be specified in resource files.
Basically, this amounts to providing new resources for specifying the
types of the widgets and the widget heirarchy.  In addition, Wcl
provides several callbacks and action functions which many programs
need.

See README20 for general information about Wcl version 2, and README22
for additional features introduced in Wcl version 2.2 and version 2.1,
and README23 for new features in Wcl 2.3.

New Features of Wcl 2.4
------------------------

This is conceptually a patch, but since patch doesn't deal with
removed files and renamed files, this is a new release.

Bug Fixes
---------
WcConvert.c		- Fixed problem with converting string-to-widget
			  from application shell.

Ori examples		- ORi now works...

Table Widget
------------

More improvements in resizing.  Specifically, WcSameSize now causes
widgets to *remain* the same size IF they have their `W' or `H'
layout options set.  Also, widgets are resized relatively instead
of by equal pixel amounts.  This looks alot better.

XmpTable now should build easier on HP systems, thanks to Eric F.
Johnson (johnsone@camax.com).

Bug fixed: table would compute a preferred size of 0 if margins were
zero and no children.  This would cause XConfigureWindow to barf with
a zero sized window if the table's parent did not check for zero
sized children.

Make and Imake changes for Clients
----------------------------------

It is now much easier to use the Imakefiles and MakeByHand files for
clients which you evolve from the resource interpreters.  You can
simply copy, say, Mri/Mri.c and Mri/Imakefile into a new directory,
rename Mri.c and edit the Imakefile CLIENT and CLASS value, and start
developing.

The kludgy stuff to pre-process app-defaults files is now gone.

Build Instructions
------------------

See README_BUILD for detailed instructions on how to build the
distribution.

If you are using imake, you MUST look at Wc.tmpl and make the necessary
edits.  The distribution provides several versions of this file,
probably NONE are exactly what you need:

 Wc.tmpl	My machine, an IPX with X11R5 patch level 12, Motif 1.1.0
		with HUNDREDS of fixes, OpenLook widgets, and debugged Xt 
		library with memory tracing enabled and file tracing hacks.

 Wc.tmpl.irix	Should work as-is on Irix (Silicon Graphics) machines with
		SGI X (R4) and Motif installations.


If you are using make, you MUST look at WcMake1.tmpl and WcMake2.tmpl.
Again, a couple of different versions of these files are provided, but
you almost certainly must do something to make it build on your
platform.

 WcMake1.tmpl	These work on my machine
 WcMake2.tmpl

 WcMake1.svr4	These work on SVR4 machines with X11R4 and Motif 1.1,
 WcMake2.svr4	and are used to make dynamic libraries.

 WcMake1.svr4.a	These work on SVR4 machines with X11R4 and Motif 1.1.,
 WcMake2.svr4.a	and are used to create static libraries.

 WcMake1.sco	These work on SCO Open Desk Top machines.  Whew!  Also,
 WcMake2.sco	installable man pages (*S.z, *C.z) are now provided.
