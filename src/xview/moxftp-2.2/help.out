Short Listing
Medium Listing
Long Listing
Translation Listing
Translations

The short listing format  displays  the  filename  only.  If  the
remote  file  system  is an UNIX system then a directory will end
with "/", a link with "@" and of offline file with "%".   If  the
remote  file system is not an unix file system then a d is placed
before the file name to indicate that it is a directory.

The Medium  Listing  format  is  system  dependent.   It  usually
includes the file length.

The Long Listing format is system dependent.  It usually includes
the file length, type and protections.

The Translation Listing format will display the remote  to  local
or  the  local  to  remote  translation  for  the directory being
displayed.  It also shows the mode the file will  be  transferred
in.   If XXXX does not know how to translate the filename it will
leave the translation blank.

*dotxftp.help_text:
XXXX initialization file
XXXX reads the ".xftp" initialization file in the home  directory
when  it  first starts up.  The ".xftp" file can contain the fol-
lowing directives:

trans        <machine type>
examples_r   <remote file>
examples_e   <local file>
unix         <regular expression>
             <source> [<conversion type>]
back         <regular expression>
             <source> [<conversion type>]
end
viewer       <audio|ps|picture|tar|text> <comand>

The note directive allows you add a note that is displayed in the
host  list  menu  in the login window.  It is used in conjunction
with the "~/.netrc" file.

The trans directive start a translation table block of  commands.
You  can  only  specify the examples_r, examples_e, unix and back
directive in a translation table block.  The end  directive  ends
the translation table block.

The examples_r and examples_e directives are used to  generate  a
example of the translations specified by the unix and back direc-
tives.

The unix and back directive are used to specific rewriting  rules
for translating file form the remote system file name to unix and
back.  You can specify "ascii", "binary" and "tenex" as  <conver-
sion type>

The examples_r, examples_e,  unix  and  back  directives  can  be
repeated 50 times each.

The following is example of a translation table  that  you  might
want for a Vax VMS system running MULTINET.

trans        VMS MULTINET
examples_r   XFTP_TAR.Z;1
unix         ([a-z0-9_,]+)_TAR.Z;[0-9]+
             1.tar.Z binary
examples_e   xftp.tar.Z
back         ([A-Z0-9_,]+).tar.Z
             1_TAR.Z  binary
end

The unix directive specifies a regular expression to apply to the
remote  file  name.   If  it matches then the string "1.tar.Z" is
used as the source  to  rewrite  the  file  name.  This  examples
translate  "XFTP_TAR.Z;1"  to the unix file name "xftp.tar.Z" and
specifies that the file is to be transferred in binary mode.

The back directive specifies a regular expression to apply to the
local unix file.  If it matches then the string "1_TAR.Z" is used
as  the  source  to  rewrite  the  file  name.   The  unix   file
"xftp.tar.Z" should be rewritten as "XFTP_TAR.Z".  The file would
be transferred in binary mode.

The viewer directive spicfies a program  to  execute  to  view  a
audio, postscript, tar, text and picture files.  XXXX regogonizes
the filename  extensions  .aiff  and  .au  as  audio  files;  the
filename   extensions .gif, .tiff, .rgp and .jpg as pictures; the
the filename extesions .ps as postscript; and the filname  exten-
sion
example:
viewer ps ghostview
viewer text xless
viewer pitcure xv
