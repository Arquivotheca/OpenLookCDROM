This directory contains the source to xftp/mftp/oftp 2.1 a
Athena (xftp), Motif (mftp) or Open LOOK (oftp) interface to ftp.

The simplest whay to configure and build moxftp is to  type:
    configure motif     - To build mftp the Motif version of moxftp
    configure athena    - To build xftp the Athena version of moxftp
    configure athena3d  - To build xftp using the 3D Athena version of moxftp
    configure openlook  - To build oftp the Open LOOK version of moxftp

To install edit moxftp.tmpl and choose the desired compile time options.

 Ultirx with Motif installed in /usr/lib/DXM (mftp version):
  Define USE_MOTIF in moxftp.tmpl.
  If you have Motif 1.1 installed in /usr/lib/DXM, you need only run
  the "shells/make_ultrix.sh" shell script.  This will build the motif
  version,  mftp, of xftp/mftp/oftp. You should be able to do a "make install"
  after the make script is finished.

 SunOS 4.1.X with Openwindows 2.1 (xftp version):
  Define USE_XAW in moxftp.tmpl.
  Define the shell variable OPENWINHOME to the Openwindow 2.1 directory,
  if it ss not installed in  /usr/openwin, and then run the
  "shells/make_openwin.sh" shell script.  This will build the Athena version,
  xftp, of xftp/mftp/oftp.  You should be able to do a "make install"
  after the make script is finished.

 SunOS 4.1.X with Openwindows 2.1 (oftp version):
  Define USE_OPENWINDOW in moxftp.tmpl.
  Define the shell variable OPENWINHOME to the Openwindow 2.1 directory,
  if it not installed in the default place /usr/openwin, and then run the
  "shells/make_openwin.sh" shell script.  This will build the Open Look version,
  oftp, of xftp/mftp/oftp.  You should be able to do a "make install"
  after the make script is finished.

 Solaris 2.1 with Openwindows 3.0 (xftp version):
  Define USE_XAW in moxftp.tmpl.
  Define the shell variable OPENWINHOME to the Openwindow 3.0 directory,
  if it iss not installed in  /usr/openwin, and then run the
  "shells/make_solaris_openwin.sh" shell script.  This will build the Athena 
  version,
  xftp, of xftp/mftp/oftp.  You should be able to do a "make install"
  after the make script is finished.  You wil have to set the LD_PATH to
  include $OPENWINHOME/lib before you can run xftp.

 Solaris 2.1 with Openwindows 3.0 (oftp version):
  Define USE_OPENWINDOW in moxftp.tmpl.
  Define the shell variable OPENWINHOME to the Openwindow 3.0 directory,
  if it not installed in the default place /usr/openwin, and then run the
  "shells/make_solaris_openwin.sh" shell script.  This will build the Open Look 
  version, oftp, of xftp/mftp/oftp.  You should be able to do a "make install"
  after the make script is finished. You wil have to set the LD_PATH to
  include $OPENWINHOME/lib.

 Aix 3.2 with the installed motif libraries directions:
  Define USE_MOTIF in moxftp.tmpl.
  Run the  "shells/make_aix3.2.sh" script.  This will build the motif
  version, mftp, of xftp/mftp/oftp.  You should be able to do a "make install"
  after the make script is finished.

 HP with installed motif libraries:
  (This may not work.  I really need someone to work with me on a
   HP port.  I don't have acces to any HP machine any more)
  Define USE_MOTIF in moxftp.tmpl.
  Run the  "shells/make_hp.sh" script.  This will build the motif
  version, mftp, of xftp/mftp/oftp.  You should be able to do a "make install"
  after the make script is finished.
  If have not build the version of xftp/mftp/oftp on a HP machine.
  If you don't have a ANSI compiler you may not be to build it.

 UNICOS 6.1.6 with installed Athena libraries 
  Define USE_xaw in moxftp.tmpl.
  Run the  "/usr/bin/X11/xmkmf" then type "make World". This will build the 
  Athena version, xftp, of xftp/mftp/oftp.  
  You should be able to do a "make install" after the make script is finished.
  If you choose to use pty instead of the ftp program included in this
  package then you will also need to install fixpty before running xftp.

 Convex Os 10.1 With installed Athena libraries
   Define USE_XAW in moxftp.tmpl.
   Run the  "/usr/bin/X11/xmkmf" then type "make World". This will build the 
   Athena version, xftp, of xftp/mftp/oftp.

 Convex Os 10.1 with installed motif libraries
   Define USE_MOTIF in moxftp.tmpl.
   Run the  "/usr/bin/X11/xmkmf" then type "make World". This will build the 
   motif version, mftp, of xftp/mftp/oftp.

 IRIX System V.3 With installed Athena libraries
   Define USE_XAW in moxftp.tmpl.
   Run the  "/usr/bin/X11/xmkmf" then type "make World". This will build the

If you have a properly configured xmkmf you should be able to type "xmkmf" and 
then "make World" after choosing which version xftp or mftp 
of xftp/mftp/oftp the you whish to build.
 
You will need perl if you plan to update the resource files or help text.

If you have already installed a older version of xftp/mftp you may need
to add the "-debug" parameter on xftp/mftp/oftp to test it out before you
install it.
