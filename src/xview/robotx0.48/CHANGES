0.48
----

Bug fixes to enable robot to run under LINUX (free UNIX clone
for IBM PC compatibles).

WRITE - writes values of variables etc. Argument is a list of
any valid parameters (e.g. write 2/3 a1+5 xmin mean).


0.47 
----

Added Zoom and Pan commands (ZOOMIN, ZOOMOUT, PANRIGHT, PANLEFT, PANUP,
PANDOWN) and a control panel to access them. Amount of zoom and pan are
controlled by ZOOMVALUE and PANVALUE.

"Special" characters (e.g. Greek characters, math symbols) for text
strings can be accessed via panel lists.

Control panel added to help with creation/selection of sub-windows in
the plotting area, sub-window gaps, etc.

POLYFILL - draw a filled polygon.

New plot mode: FILL. FILLSTYLE specifies how FILL works (e.g. fill to
minimum, maximum, specified level etc.)

Confirmation requested before a plot window is destroyed.

Double clicking required on directories in file selector.

No. of copies can be specified when printing.

Multiple commands can be entered on one line separated by semicolons
(;).

IF tests work correctly inside LOOPs.

POSITIONPLOT - set location of plotting window to a specified position
on the screen.

NEWPLOTAREA - create a new plotting area. Current plot area is
retained. (Equivalent to existing panel button functionality).

0.46
----

Any plot window can be made the current plotting area. i.e. old windows
can be drawn to, printed, resized etc. (Use right hand mouse button
in old plot area).

CD - changes working directory.

WINDOWGAP, XWINDOWGAP, YWINDOWGAP - specify spacing between sub-plots.

Support for Japanese text (for hardcopy output requires that you have
Japanese PostScript fonts installed on your printer).

Command line argument of -notol (not Open Look) adds "Dismiss" buttons
to windows to ease use with non-Open Look window managers such as twm
or mwm.

Clicking/dragging in current plot area displays coordinates in frame footer.

Close down panel has "Clear log file and continue" option.

ARROWANGLE - changes shape of arrow heads.

3DFILL/3DNOFILL - specify whether 3D plots fill all the plot area.

CURSOR command also prints coordinates of nearest data point.

Print control panel allows printer to be specified.

Entries in file selector are sorted (Carlos Puchol).

PLOTFILE command is now DATAFILE. (Although the old form is still
recognised.)

Aliases are included in a pull-down menu. (Invisible if no aliases
are specified).

Additional math functions: CEIL, FLOOR, ROUND, J0, J1.

The parameters obtained from least squares fits and their errors
can be accessed via the functions FITVALUE and FITERROR.



0.45 patchlevel 4
-----------------
Bug fixes plus added extra fonts (avantgarde, bookman etc.)

0.45
----
Bug fixes to allow Robot to run on DECstations again.

The plotting area is no longer attached to the command area.

Additional plot areas can be created with previous ones retained
for display (but old areas cannot be drawn to).

The plot area has a menu associated with it (use right mouse button).

Color can be changed inside a text string (\red, \green, \blue,
\white, \black). Color change only applies inside the text string.

Double clicking on a text string in the plot area enables
it to be edited.

A command line argument of -landscape brings up the plot area
as landscape orientation. The default is portrait mode. Button added
to switch between landscape and portrait.

SolidLines, DashedLines, DottedLines and DotDashedLines - specify
different line styles for drawing.

ARC - draws circular arc

POLYLINE - draws a series of connected lines.
POLYGON - as above but connects first and last points.

The main title position can be changed to the the top right,
centre or top left (default). (CENTERTITLE/CENTRETITLE, LEFTTITLE,
RIGHTTITLE).

SPLINE is now a plot mode rather than a separate command.

"Plot" menu renamed "Draw".

Draw commands can now use the right mouse button to indicate a
new start position is required for the object.


"^" as well as "**" is recognized as exponentiation.

Division of plotting area into sub-windows (DIVWINDOW,
SELWINDOW) also applies to 3D plots.

Errors on data points are available via functions as input to commands e.g. xerr{10}
is the value of the 'X' error on the 10th data point.


0.44
----

Arrows in different styles and arrow head sizes can be plotted.

Helvetica and Courier fonts also available (including bold and oblique
styles).

Additional symbols for PLOTMODE of "nice-symbol":  Triangle,
Filled-Triangle, Diamond, Filled-Diamond.

Functions available now also include absolute value (abs), exp10,
cube.

Commands can be aliased using the ALIAS command and aliases removed
using UNALIAS. NOALIASES removes all aliases.

The previously entered command may be edited using a syntax similar to
the C Shell:
^old_string^new_string^

CENTRETEXT/CENTERTEXT - plots a text string centered on a specified x
position.

Additional commands to give more flexibility in controlling axes:
tick mark size, which axes are drawn, whether tick marks are
external or internal.
An additional command frame has been added to access these commands.
TOPAXIS/NOTOPAXIS BOTTOMAXIS/NOBOTTOMAXIS RIGHTAXIS/NORIGHTAXIS
LEFTAXIS/NOLEFTAXIS ALLAXES XTICKSIZE YTICKSIZE DEFAULTTICKSIZE
EXTERNALTICKS INTERNALTICKS EXTERNALXTICKS INTERNALXTICKS
EXTERNALYTICKS INTERNALYTICKS MINORTICKSIZE MINORTICKFREQUENCY.

A compile time flag can be set to indicate that Robot should attempt to
use US spellings for labels, commands etc.

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS:
With the introduction of extra fonts the command NORMAL does not switch
from the Symbol font to the Times-Roman font. Select another font family
to stop using the Symbol font.


0.43
----
Text style and size can be changed within a string through
the use of sequences such as \if (italic font), \10 (10 point).
Also super and subscripts - \up and \dn.
Special symbols and Greek characters can be included. e.g.
\{alpha}, \{infinity}, \{Gamma}, \{aleph} etc.
(symbol names are patterned after TeX usage).

Angled text on screen uses standard X fonts.

Two new plot modes: Bar-graph and stacked-bar.

A PLOTMODE of SYMBOL can use a text string (including special
instruction sequences) as the symbol to be plotted rather than just a
single character.

OVERTYPE and TYPEMORE don't request plot labels - input is
just data.

Data points are available via functions as input to commands e.g. x{10}
is the 'X' value of the 10th data point.

Added Width 0 for line widths. This is now also the default.
Line widths on screen and hardcopy should match more closely.

PostScript output uses ISO encoding for default font (means a "-" is
a minus and not a hyphen)


0.42
----
Drag and drop from the file manager supported - 
FILE "filename" is executed or PLOTFILE "filename" if the file name
ends in ".dat".

WRITEDATA now only writes out data within the region selected
for plotting.

One or more files may be given as command line arguments
(e.g. $ robot file.rob
 or   $ robot file1 file2)
This also enables you to get the file manager to run robot by
double-clicking on a file if you set things up correctly using the
"binder".

Double clicking enabled in history list, file selector and other panel
list items.

PLOTFILE will now add ".dat" to a file name and try opening that if it
can't find the file name as given.

Titles and axis labels are more accurately positioned.


0.41 Changes
------------
File selector allows filters (e.g. ".rob" files); typing a directory
name (including ~) will allow a change to that directory.

Sending a postscript file directly to the printer does not now create a
file in the current directory as well. Trying to create a file in a
directory without write permission doesn't crash the program. A bug in
creating postscript files which used a plotmode of "nice-symbol" was
fixed.

"!" may be used to repeat a previous command (similar to usage in the C
shell).

Commands stored in the "history" command frame can be edited.

# is allowed as a comment in files.

Extra error checking for monochrome machines.

It is suspected (but not confirmed!) that robot 0.41 will build
under version 2 of XView as well as version 3.

0.40 from 0.35
--------------
Incomplete list:
Colour used to plot data can be specified independently of
rest of plot.
Most recent commands (~10) can be repeated.
Arguments of commands can include functions.
"Draw" commands use rubber-banding.
Two extra "draw" commands - CIRCLE and ELLIPSE.
Two new plot modes: "PILLAR" and "ELLIPSE".
Limited experimental 3D modes are included.
Extra commands: (PAUSE, WAIT, FLUSH, MOVETO, LINETO).
Postscript output can either be scaled to the page size or
relative scaling (WYSIWYG) is maintained.
File selection (e.g. for "FILE" and "PLOTFILE" commands) can be done
via the mouse.
Facility for emailing bug reports to author incorporated.

Numerous small bug fixes and speed-ups.
