HELP FOR THE WORDS MENU

:Text
Text
[TEXT]

Add text to the plot.

Text style and size can be changed inside a
string.  This is activated using a \ followed by
a two character code:

\sf	Symbol Font
\if	Italic Font
\bf	Bold Font
\bi	Bold Italic
\nf	normal Font (not italic or bold)
\hf	Helvetica Font
\cf	Courier Font
\tf	Times Font
\up	move up to a position 1/2 the font size 
            higher (superscript)
\dn	move down .....
\bs     move back one character size (approx.)

or a text size such as
\08
\10
\12
\18  etc.

To decrease or increase the font size by
two points use \- and \+ respectively.

e.g. 
O\dn\bs\bs8\bs\up\up\bs16 will give you something
like:
16
  O
 8

Special characters may be obtained using
sequences such as \{infinity}. This can also
be used as alternative way of generating
Greek characters. e.g. \{alpha}, \{Gamma}.



#

font.
#

:Times

#

:Kanji
Kanji
[KANJI]

Use the (Japanese) Kanji font. Standard ASCII
characters are printed as normal. To access
additional symbols in the Kanji font there are
two methods:  Use a sequence such as
\[ka]
This will print the hiragana equivalent of the
"ka" syllable. To use katakana instead use
\[Ka]

If you know the JIS code this can also be used.
For example
\[3b33]
will print the symbol "yama" (mountain).

The escape sequences used for JIS are also
recognised.  As the Escape character is not
accepted in the text prompt, to be able to print
this type of text you'll probably need to include
it in a .rob file and use the "FILE" command to
access it.

angled text displayed on the screen looks
somewhat messy any hardcopy angled text will not
