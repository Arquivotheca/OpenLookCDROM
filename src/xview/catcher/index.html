<H1>Catcher, a scripting language</H1>
<P>Well, the title tells it. Catcher is a neat scripting language,
like Tk but written several years earlier, by Chuck Musciano, originally
for SunView and then for XView/OPEN LOOK.
Due to the copyright, we were not able to include Catcher at this time,
however you can obtain a copy by FTP from many archive sites, including
<A HREF="ftp://qiclab.scn.rain.com/pub/sun/catcher.tar.Z">Rain.com</A>.
It is on many other sites, so if that site doesn't work, use archie
or your favorite Net Searching tool to find a copy.
