In the last time I got many mails from people asking me where to purchase
supported videotext-cards. Thus I have compiled this list to help you to
find the right interface for you. Please note that I have no connection to
these companies and that this list definitely is incomplete. Also, I don't
know if the prices are still correct or if these companies still sell these
cards. If you know other sources for the supported cards, please tell me.

ALSO, I CAN'T PROMISE THAT ANY OF THESE CARDS WILL WORK FOR YOU. I DON'T OWN
ANY OF THEM, BUT I GOT MAIL FROM SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO USE MY DRIVER WITH THESE
CARDS. IF YOU CAN'T GET ONE OF THESE CARDS TO WORK, PLEASE TELL ME (I'LL TRY
TO FIND A SOLUTION FOR YOUR PROBLEM, BUT I WON'T GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY BACK IF
IT DOESN'T WORK).
(Sorry for shouting :-)


o c't-interface:
  This is no ready-to-run device, you only can buy the PCB and the
  programmed address-decoder chip. You still need a SAA5246 and some other
  parts. You also need the article from c't 7/92 which tells you how to
  build this interface (you can order copies for 5,-DM from eMedia). You
  should only try to build this interface if you know which end of a
  soldering iron gets hot :-)
  BTW, you can use the PCB for both the internal & externel (serial port)
  version. If you want to build the external version, you don't need the
  ASIC/PAL.

  You can order the PCB (9207176dBE, 33,-DM) and the ASIC/PAL (9207178GAL,
  19,-DM) from:
  eMedia GmbH
  Postfach 610106
  D-30601 Hannover
  Tel. +49-511-537295
  Fax. +49-511-5352147

o VTX2000/VD3000:
  This is a ready-to-run internal card for ISA-slots. The VD3000 has an
  additional (unsupported) videodat-decoder. Don't buy the VD2000, it is an
  unsupported external interface with videodat decoder. The order-no. for
  the VTX2000S is 10-152-86; you can get it for 169,-DM from:
  ELV GmbH
  D-26787 Leer
  Tel. +49-491-600888
  Fax. +49-491-7016

  I couldn't find the VD3000 in their current catalog. Also, it seems that
  the PCVT 7000 is no longer sold.

o KDK SATCOM:
  This is a ready-to-run external interface that can be connected to a
  serial port. You can get it for 99,-DM from:
  KDK SATCOM
  Welperstr. 17
  D-45525 Hattingen
  Tel. +49-2324-55306
  Fax. +49-2324-55316
