Here's how to get the latest version of VideoteXt:

The latest "official" version can always be found on
ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc
Normally, I will also upload new versions to
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/video

I won't put Alpha-Releases on these sites -- instead you can get them
directly from our WWW-Server (worldwide access should be possible now):
http://www.uni-ulm.de/~s_buck/VideoteXt.html
If I have enough time I'll also put a "release of the week" on this server
so you can try out the latest features (though I can't guarantee that
anything will work in these versions). You can also find the latest news
about VideoteXt on this page.

If you don't have full Internet-access, I can send you VideoteXt by E-mail
(please tell me if you can handle MIME/Base64-encoded mails or if you want
it UUencoded). Another possibility is to get VideoteXt from one of the
public dial-in archives which mirror sunsite (such as contrib.de in Berlin,
Germany (dial +49-30-6934051 or +49-30-6946055, login as 'archive' for
Zmodem-downloads)).

If all this really fails I can send you VideoteXt on disk or QIC80-tape by
snail-mail, if you send me a stamped return-envelope and the media.
