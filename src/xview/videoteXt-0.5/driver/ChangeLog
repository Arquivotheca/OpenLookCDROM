Version 1.4
  o Added ioctl-commands to display page on TV-screen. This uses lots of evil
    and undocumented "features", so I can't promise that it will work. Also, I
    don't know if all cards support this mode.
  o Improved error-checking
  o Added support for KDK SATCOM-cards (thanks to Martin Höppner for info
    and patches)
  o Added support for ELV PCTV 7000 cards (***UNTESTED***)

Version 1.3
  o Added support for serial c't-cards (thanks to Carsten Bobek for patches)
  o Fix to make driver work with kernels >1.1.93 with symbols that have
    version-information appended (CONFIG_MODVERSIONS)

Version 1.2
  o Added support for VTX2000/videodat cards (thanks to Volker Schuermann
    for info about these cards)
  o Added commandline-arguments for modutils 1.1.67 and above
  o Removed support for minor-numbers > 0 to enable debugging. Use debug=x
    instead.
  o Fixed bug in pageinfo-struct with page-numbers between 0x800 and 0x8ff
  o Added some verify_area's to prevent segfaults in the kernel (why doesn't
    the kernel hacker's guide or other documentation about device-drivers
    mention this??? Grrrr...)

Version 1.1
  o Added VTXIOCSTOPDAU to make it possible to stop a data acquisition unit
  o Added some debugging-messages
  o Added delay for VTXIOCCLRPAGE

Version 1.0
  o Initial release
