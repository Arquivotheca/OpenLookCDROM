Version 0.5
  o Yup, it's finally there: subpage-support
  o Added support for INtv-format & implemented display-only mode for use
    with X-Window WWW-browsers like Mosaic & Netscape (check
    http://www.ntu.ac.sg/intv/intv_www.html for details)
  o Added PostScript-output
  o Improved TOP-text popup-window (added menus for page-overview and
    page-hierarchy)
  o Added automatic station-change detection
  o Added user-settable index-page-number
  o Gadget-popups now get (de)iconified whenever the main window is
    (de)iconified
  o Added info-window showing current number of pages & memory consumption
  o Changed 'Reveal'-hotkey from Meta-V to Meta-E due to severe braindamage
    in XView
  o vtxget now can read pages from disk, so you can use it as a filter
    for printing already received pages
  o Optimized screen-updates
  o Fixed bug in TOP-text-function used to find out the name of the current
    page
  o TOP-text-pages with errors weren't re-requested correctly, so TOP-text
    sometimes failed completely until the next reset
  o Fixed really stupid bug in geometry-management that caused wrong font-
    size to be selected under some circumstances when resizing the main-
    window
  o Did a lot of code-clean-up (I guess diff wouldn't find many matching
    lines :-)
  o Better error-checking for CCT-functions (well, in fact there was hardly
    any error checking up to now :-)

Version 0.4
  o Added TOP-Text support
  o Improved commandline-version (several output-formats, better handling of
    of subpages, implemeted batch-queue for pages), now in a seperate binary
    (so you can use vtxget even if you don't have XView installed
  o Looks better on 1-bit displays (very slow, unfortunately)
  o Fixed bug with automatic popup-placement (occured on OSF/1's X-Server
    and TekXpress-terminals (possibly also on others with backing store for
    all windows))
  o Added support for system-wide configuration-files
  o New 15x18-pixel font

Version 0.3
  o First alpha-release with XView-GUI
  o Many new features: Hotlist, history, background search, save & load VTX-
    pages, export pages as ASCII, GIF, PPM
  o Automatic window-placement for popups (doesn't work with every window-
    manager)

Version 0.2
  o Switched to external videotext-driver (no more direct hardware-access)
  o Allowed hexadecimal pages in page-selection
  o Fixed some minor bugs

Version 0.1
  o Initial release (only sent to some alpha-testers)
