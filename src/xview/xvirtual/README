Compile XVirtual:
-----------------

The package contains a static linked binary. To reduce the size of the
executable it is recomended to compile xvirtual.

g++ and xview is required !!

makedepend *.cc
make

Documentation:
--------------

latex XVirtual.tex     (please ignore warnings.)
latex XVirtual.tex     (It must be done two times !!)

Postscript printer:
dvips XVirtual.dvi

EPSON printer:
dvips -o XVirtual.ps XVirtual.dvi
gs -sDEVICE=epson XVirtual.ps | lpr

Run XVirtual
------------

XVirtual requires a 256 psoydocolor X-Server. 216 free color-cells must be 
available. If you got problems with colors, please close all other aplications.
The use of colors in xvirtual is quick and dirty. If someone could change the
code to use private color-cells (x.cc), I would be very pleased.

Open an X-Terminal
Type
     cd XVirtual	
     xvirtual [file]

Good examples are

xvirtual spider
xvirtual walk
xvirtual garden
xvirtual demo
