Nothing is new. Sorry.
It is and was version 1.0
 
I got a lot of mail from people who has problems with XVirtual. 

- can't compile XVirtual
- G++-2.6 don't work
- where to find include-files  
- where to find xview
- got segmentation fault
and some others.

While XVirtual runs propperly on my system, I decided to include a
static linked binary to the package. 
I used the -Xlinker -static option to compile the program, but I don't know
wether it works on systems, where xview is not installt.
Please tell me wether is works or not. 
The size of the binary is 1.6 MB. With shared libaries the size is only 260kb.
So you should try to run 'make'.

Have fun and be happy with XVirtual
