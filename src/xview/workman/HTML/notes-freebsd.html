<h1>FreeBSD notes</h1>

<p>
WorkMan was ported to FreeBSD by Todd Pfaff
(<a href="mailto:todd@flex.eng.mcmaster.ca">todd@flex.eng.mcmaster.ca</a>).

<p>
This port was developed and tested on the following:

<ul>
   <li> FreeBSD-1.1-BETA
   <li> XFree86-2.0
   <li> xview3.2 (from the FreeBSD ports collection)
   <li> Adaptec 1542C SCSI controller
   <li> Toshiba XM-3401B CDROM drive
</ul>

<h2>Building from source</h2>

If you have FreeBSD-1.1, XFree86-2.0 and xview3.2 installed you should be
able to build and install workman with:

<blockquote>
  xmkmf<br>
  make<br>
  make install<br>
  make install.man
</blockquote>

<h2>Known problems</h2>

All CD drive IO is done using the FreeBSD CDIO interface defined in cdio.h.
I didn't attempt to write the wm_scsi() SCSI interface code in plat_freebsd.c
so direct SCSI support is not available.  Implementing this would allow the
SCSI drive specific routines from drv_*.c to be taken advantage of.
Perhaps the SCSI user library submitted to the FreeBSD-hackers list by
Peter Dufault (hd@world.std.com) could be used for this purpose.

<p>
The CDIOREADTOCENTRYS fails if an attempt is made to read past the last track
found with CDIOREADTOCHEADER and I couldn't figure out any way to get the
length of the last CD track.  If anyone fixes this please let me know how.
I hardcoded the last track length as 10 minutes which is obviously an ugly
solution.

<p>
The CDIOCEJECT ioctl doesn't eject the CD from my drive.

<p>
The volume control isn't the greatest and I didn't spend any time trying to
improve it.

<p>
The balance control doesn't work very well.
