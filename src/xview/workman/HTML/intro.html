<h1>What is WorkMan?</h1>

<p>
WorkMan is a graphical tool for playing audio compact discs on a CD-ROM
drive.  It has most of the features available on standalone CD players,
such as a shuffle mode, programmable playlists, and elapsed/remaining
timers.  But it also has extra features, foremost of which is the ability
to store information about CDs in a database, then automatically extract
that information when the CD is inserted later.  WorkMan stores the
artist's name, the disc title, the names of individual tracks, and even
remembers which tracks you don't want to hear!  All in an easy-to-use,
attractive OPEN LOOK graphical interface.

<p>
Disc databases may be shared among any number of users on the network.
WorkMan keeps separate databases for your private information about
CDs (e.g. which order you like the tracks to play) and the discs' public
information.  During WorkMan's alpha test, several users shared my
database, which now contains over 1300 CDs.  That
<a href="ftp://ftp.hyperion.com/WorkMan/workmandb.gz">database</a>
is available via anonymous ftp from
<a href="ftp://ftp.hyperion.com/WorkMan/">ftp.hyperion.com</a>
in the "WorkMan" directory.

<p>
WorkMan requires XView 3.0 or higher (which comes with the OpenWindows
distribution, and is also available as part of X11R6.)

<p>
The manual page (workman.man) contains a brief description of the user
interface, though for the most part you should be able to start using
the tool right away without reading the docs.  If you're curious about
the program's innards, the workmandb.man manual page describes the
database file format.
