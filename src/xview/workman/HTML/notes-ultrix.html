<h1>ULTRIX notes</h1>

<p>
WorkMan was ported to ULTRIX by Chris Ross
(<a href="mailto:cross@eng.umd.edu">cross@eng.umd.edu</a>).  Bug
reports should still be sent to me at
<a href="mailto:koreth@hyperion.com">koreth@hyperion.com</a>, though; I will
forward ULTRIX-specific reports to Chris.

<p>
This program should compile and run under ULTRIX 4.2.  You will need the
XView toolkit, version 3.0 or higher.  An ULTRIX port of XView is available
from many sites via anonymous ftp.  Use archie to find one near you.  Neither
Chris nor I can supply people with XView sources, so please don't ask.

<p>
You will need to use "imake" to build a Makefile suitable for ULTRIX; the
supplied Makefile is tuned for Suns (though it isn't hard to adjust if you
prefer not to use imake).  The usual way of running imake is to type "xmkmf"
and let it figure out all the parameters.

<p>
There is a WorkMan binary at ftp.hyperion.com:/WorkMan/ultrix.tar.Z if you
can't find XView or don't want to bother installing it.  You may need to
install the OPEN LOOK fonts, though; they are available from ftp.hyperion.com
as well as with the generic XView source distribution, available widely in
the contrib section of X11R5.  You do not need to build XView from source to
get the fonts from the source distribution.

<p>
If you get an error like "Cannot open connection to window server", try
any of several things:

<ol>
<li>Specify the font explicitly, e.g. "workman -fn lucidasans-12".  If you
   don't have the OPEN LOOK fonts installed, try "Courier10" instead.
<li>Set your DISPLAY environment variable to ":0.0".
<li>Set your DISPLAY environment variable to "hostname:0" (substituting your
   display host for "hostname", of course).
</ol>

<p>
Those are all the things ULTRIX people have reported as fixes.  If they
don't work, unfortunately there's not much I can do about it.

<p>
For those who'd like to read through the source, note that the ULTRIX-
specific code is all contained in plat_ultrix.c.
