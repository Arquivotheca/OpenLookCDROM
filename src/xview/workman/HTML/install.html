<h1>How to Install WorkMan</h1>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
WorkMan requires XView version 3 or higher.  This is supplied by default on Sun
systems (though you may have to select the "OpenWindows Developers" category
from your SunOS or Solaris CD to get the necessary files for compiling) and is
available as part of the "contrib" distribution in X11R5 and X11R6 for other
systems.

<p>
Some of the Makefiles assume that OPENWINHOME is set to the Sun OpenWindows 3.x
home directory.  Some tweaking will probably be required if you're not using
OpenWindows; OPENWINHOME is used to locate the XView include files and
libraries.

<h2>Building</h2>

<p>
How you build WorkMan depends on which platform you're trying to build it on.
The following are the quick-and-dirty instructions, and will often suffice,
but you should follow the link on your platform's name for more information.

<p>
On most platforms, you can configure WorkMan to use a database library from
4.4BSD to look CDs up very quickly.  More details on that
<a href="#libdb">below.</a>

<dl>
<dt>SunOS 4.x
<dd>
	Edit "Makefile" and comment out the Solaris 2 lines (SOL2, LIBLOC,
	and EXTRA_LIBS).  Then
	type "make".  You may want to use the "-e" option when you run
	WorkMan; see the manpage.

<p>
<dt><a href="notes-solaris2.html">Solaris 2.x</a>
<dd>
	If you're not using gcc, adjust the Makefile accordingly.  Then type
	"make".

<p>
<dt><a href="notes-ultrix.html">ULTRIX</a><br>
    <a href="notes-news.html">NEWS-OS</a><br>
    <a href="notes-bsd386.html">BSD/386</a><br>
    <a href="notes-freebsd.html">FreeBSD</a>
<dd>
	Run "imake" or "xmkmf" to convert the supplied Imakefile to a Makefile.
	Or edit the Makefile to point to the right directories.

<p>
<dt><a href="notes-hpux.html">HP-UX</a>
<dd>
	Edit "Makefile.hpux" to point to the correct directories, then type
	"make -f Makefile.hpux" to build WorkMan.  You may want to use the
	"-e" option when you run WorkMan; see the manpage.

<p>
<dt><a href="notes-linux.html">Linux</a>
<dd>
	Edit "Makefile.linux" to point to the correct directories.  Uncomment
	the PASS line if appropriate (see the Makefile.)
	Then type "make -f Makefile.linux" to build WorkMan.

<p>
<dt><a href="notes-svr4.html">SVr4 4.0</a>
<dd>
	Edit "Makefile.svr4" to point to the right directories, then type
	"make -f Makefile.svr4".

<p>
<dt><a href="notes-osf1.html">OSF/1</a>
<dd>
	<em>Note: OSF/1 is not officially supported; the code is known to
	have problems on many systems.</em>
	Edit "Makefile.osf1" to point to the right directories, then type
	"make -f Makefile.osf1".  Note that this port is preliminary and
	there are known problems (see README.osf1 for details).

</dl>

<h3><a name="libdb">Using the libdb package</a></h3>

WorkMan can optionally make use of the 4.4BSD "libdb" package to speed up
database lookups tremendously.  Here's how to use it.

<ol>
   <li> For now, you have to get libdb separately; it's available on
	<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/4bsd/">ftp.cs.berkeley.edu</a>
	in /ucb/4bsd.

   <li> Unpack libdb in the WorkMan source directory.  A subdirectory called
	"db.1.85" will be created.  

   <li> <code>cd db.1.85/PORT</code>

   <li> Have a look at the README file if you like.

   <li> There are a bunch of system-specific directories in PORT.  Look for
	the system name that most closely resembles yours.  Go into it.

   <li> <code>make</code>

   <li> Go back to the WorkMan source directory (<code>cd ../../..</code>).

   <li> Edit your system's Makefile, or the Imakefile if that's what you're
	using.  You'll see a comment about libdb; the lines below that define
	some compiler options and the path to the libdb library.  Uncomment
	those lines and make sure the paths point to the PORT directory you
	built libdb in.

   <li> <code>make</code> (with appropriate arguments, e.g.
	<code>-f Makefile.linux</code>, for your system.)

</ol>

<p>
If you have an old WorkMan database sitting around, you should build an index
file for it; WorkMan itself only writes to the index file when you save or
update a CD.  There's a program called "buildindex" to build index files.
Type "<code>make buildindex</code>" (specifying an alternate Makefile as
appropriate) after you've built WorkMan.  To run buildindex, just give it the
path to your database file as an argument, e.g. "<code>buildindex
$HOME/.workmandb</code>".

<p>
One thing to be careful of is using libdb on a database you're sharing via NFS
on a system without working file locking.  If you run WorkMan with the "-n"
option to bypass the file locking code, you risk corrupting the index file if
two people save CDs at once.  If you're the only one using a CD database, or
the only one with write access to it, you can safely use -n in conjunction
with libdb; it's only when two or more entries are saved simultaneously that
problems can occur.  In that case the best solution is to bug your sysadmin,
or your UNIX vendor, to give you working file locking.

<h2>Installing</h2>

<p>
Once the executable is built, install it in your favorite directory for such
things.  The file "workman.info" should be placed in the XView help directory,
usually $OPENWINHOME/lib/help.  If you put it somewhere else, be sure to set
your HELPPATH environment variable to point to that directory.  This is
necessary if you want to use the Help key to see the controls' descriptions.
Run "make install" to install everything under $OPENWINHOME.  You will probably
need to be root to do this.

<p>
Once all that's done, you're ready to rock and roll (or jazz, or...)
