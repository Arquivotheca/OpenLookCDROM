<h2><a name="compile">Compiling WorkMan for Solaris 2</a></h2>

<p>
WorkMan should compile without modification on Solaris 2.x, provided you
make sure the three relevant lines indicated in the Makefile are uncommented.
The LIBLOC line is
necessary to get it to run properly in conjunction with the volume manager
(vold) found in Solaris 2.2 and later.

<p>
If you're using the SPARCworks compilers from Sun, make sure your search
path is set so that "/opt/SUNWspro/bin" (or whatever directory the compilers
are in) is searched before "/usr/ucb".  Otherwise you'll be using a different
set of libraries and include files, and WorkMan won't compile properly.

<p>
If you get a message like "language optional software package not installed,"
your machine probably does not have SPARCworks, and you should talk to your
system administrator about getting gcc.


<h2><a name="gcc">Using gcc</a></h2>

<p>
You should be able to compile WorkMan using gcc.  Just uncomment the "CC=gcc"
line in the Makefile and comment out (or remove) "CC=cc".

<p>
Gcc version 2.6.0 is known to compile WorkMan on Solaris 2.4 without any
special handholding; older versions of Solaris and/or gcc apparently have
some trouble with the include files in /usr/openwin/include.  If you get
compiler errors about OpenWindows include files, you should probably run the
"fixincludes" utility that comes with gcc, giving it the correct command line
arguments so it fixes /usr/openwin/include.


<h2><a name="volmgr">Using the volume manager</a></h2>

<p>
If you're running the volume manager -- you probably are -- you can get it to
start WorkMan when you insert a music CD.  Assuming you've installed WorkMan
in /usr/openwin/bin, add the following line to /etc/rmmount.conf,
<em>before</em> the action_filemgr line:

<blockquote>
	action cdrom action_workman.so /usr/openwin/bin/workman
</blockquote>

<p>
You should already have "action_workman.so" -- it comes with Solaris.  With
that line in place, a WorkMan window should appear on your screen when you
insert a CD.

<p>
Note that the volume manager doesn't know whether you're running a window
system, so if you put in a music CD when you're not running OpenWindows (or
there's one in the drive when the system boots up) you'll have to eject it
with the "eject" command and reinsert it to get the WorkMan window to appear.

<p>
Also, WorkMan will be running as root or as nobody, not as you, since the
volume manager runs without regard to who happens to be logged in on the
console.  As a result, you'll probably want to edit your .Xdefaults file and
add the "workman.db.shared" and "workman.db.personal" resources to tell
WorkMan where to find its database files.  For example, if /users/jane is
your home directory, you'd probably add:

<blockquote>
	workman.db.shared: /users/jane/.workmandb<br>
	workman.db.personal: /users/jane/.workmanrc
</blockquote>

<p>
Then run "xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xdefaults" to load the new settings into your
X server.  You should only have to run that command once; .Xdefaults is read
automatically when you start the window system.

<p>
If you do use the volume manager to start WorkMan, you may find you have to
run "xhost hostname" (where hostname is the name of your machine) to give
root-owned processes the right to connect to your X server.

<p>
You'll also find that setting environment variables has no effect on
WorkMan when it's started by the volume manager, even if you set them before
you start the window system.  To see why, realize that environment variables
are inherited by new processes from their parents.  The volume manager is
started at system boot time, before you've logged in; it's what runs
WorkMan, so WorkMan only gets whatever variables were set when vold was
started.  Setting variables in your .cshrc, or manually in a window, does
not magically cause them to be set in preexisting processes or those
processes' children.

<h2><a name="avoid">Avoiding the volume manager</a></h2>

If all that sounds too confusing and you'd like to avoid the volume manager
altogether, you can start WorkMan by hand as long as you do it after you've
inserted a CD.

<h2><a name="audio">Getting audio output from the workstation</a></h2>

(Note: This section only applies to the SPARCstation 5, and possibly the 20.
On other machines, hook up a cable from the CD player's headphone jack to
the computer's microphone input.)

<p>
Version 1.3 of WorkMan adds code to control the audio hardware on the SS5.
It only works if there is a physical connection inside the machine between
the CD player's internal audio output and the internal audio input on the
workstation.  Instructions for making that connection are included with the
CD-ROM drive; don't ask me.

<p>
The code was added by &lt;stevep@ctc.ih.att.com&gt;, who has this to say:

<blockquote>
    I'm sure there will be problems with it, as people use hardware
    configurations I didn't imagine.  I'll be happy to try to deal with them.

<p>
    The use of audiocontrol, audiotool, gaintool, or the like in conjunction
    with this is highly recommended.  Upon initialization, it switches the
    codec input to the internal CD player, and turns the monitor gain up to
    full (necessary).  Thereafter, anytime WorkMan begins a play operation,
    it checks the state of the codec and enforces the following conditions:

<p>
	channels: 2<br>
	encoding: linear<br>
	precision: 16 bits<br>
	sample rate: 44100<br>
	monitor gain: max<br>
	input port: internal cd player

<p>
    It does NOT "own" /dev/audio, nor does it check state other than when
    beginning a "play".  This allows other processes to do things with the
    audio system.  Please note that most other things will leave the chip in
    a relatively pathetic state (8-bit ulaw mono at 8000 samples/sec);
    pausing and resuming will correct this.

<p>
    This all comes about because the headphone jack on the CD drawer sounds
    awful (lots of processor noise; apparently, Sun doesn't believe in
    shielding).  The headphone jack out the back sounds MUCH better, but one
    has to go through the audio chip to get there.

</blockquote>

<p>
Please send mail directly to him if you have problems with this aspect of
WorkMan.
