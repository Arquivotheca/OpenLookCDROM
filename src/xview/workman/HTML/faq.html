<h2>General Questions</h2>

<h3><a name="version">Do I have the latest version?</a></h3>

<p>
The official ftp site for WorkMan is
<a href="ftp://ftp.hyperion.com/WorkMan/">ftp.hyperion.com.</a>
Check there to see
if there's a more recent version than the one you're using.  The version
number can be found in the About popup.

<p>

<h3><a name="speaker">Why doesn't it play through the computer's
speaker?</a></h3>

The answer to this question is highly dependent on your hardware configuration.
Some common answers:

<dl>
<dt>SPARCstation 5 (maybe others) running Solaris
<dd>
You're in luck.  As of version 1.3, WorkMan has code to use the internal audio
connection between your CD-ROM drive and the workstation's motherboard.  You
might prefer to send the sound out the headphone jack to external speakers;
use "audiotool" to do that.  Of course, the internal connection needs to be
there for this to work; if you don't get any sound, someone probably forgot
to hook up the wires when they installed your drive.  See the Solaris 2
<a href="notes-solaris2.html#audio">release notes</a>
for more details.

<p>
<dt>PC UNIX boxes (Linux, NetBSD, Solaris x86, etc.)
<dd>
Your computer may have an internal audio connection between the CD-ROM drive
and your sound card.  If so, there's probably a utility in your OS to tell
the sound card to play back whatever input it gets from the drive.  If you
can tell me what it is on your system, I'll add it to this page.

<p>
<dt>SunOS systems
<dd>
Run an audio patch cable (available at
any decent stereo store) from the drive's headphone jack to the workstation's
audio input, then run "<tt>cat /dev/audio > /dev/audio</tt>".  Or do what I
used to do and hook a pair of speakers up to the headphone jack; you'll get
better sound that way anyway.

<p>
<dt>Solaris systems other than SPARCstation 5
<dd>
See SunOS above, but the command you want is
"<tt>audiorecord -p line -s 44.1k -e linear -c 2 | audioplay</tt>".

<p>
<dt>Others
<dd>
The patch cable idea (see SunOS) is probably applicable to most other systems;
tell me the right commands to run, or about alternatives, and I'll add them
to this list.

</dl>

<p>
A couple of drives, for instance the Toshiba XM-3401, are capable of reading
digital audio data from the CD over the SCSI bus.  A
future release of WorkMan will support playing audio through the computer's
speaker on such drives.

<h3><a name="jiggle">How do I get the controls to stop moving up and
down?</a></h3>

<p>
The window size changes as the program displays different track titles
and other things.  If you start the program with the "-geometry" option
and give a negative number for the Y coordinate, the bottom of the window
will be fixed in place and the controls won't move around.  Note that
you should specify only the window position, and not the size.  For
example,

<blockquote>
<tt>workman -geometry -0-500</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
would pop the window up on the right side of the screen, about halfway
up (on screens of typical resolution.)  "-0-0" will put the window
slightly off the bottom of the screen because there's no way to tell how
tall the window manager's decorations are.  Play with the numbers until
the WorkMan window pops up where you want it; under olwm version 3,
"-0-38" will put the window in the lower right corner.

<p>
<hr align=center width="50%">

<h3><a name="background">How do I change the background color?</a>

<p>
The -background option, you've probably noticed, doesn't work as expected
on XView programs.  What you need to do is set the
<code>OpenWindows.windowColor</code> X resource to the color you want.
You can do that without touching other XView applications by doing it on
WorkMan's command line using the -xrm option, e.g.

<blockquote>
<tt>workman -xrm "OpenWindows.windowColor: skyblue"</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
<hr align=center width="50%">

<h3><a name="motif">Is there a Motif interface?</a></h3>

<p>
Not yet.  A few people are working on one, among them
&lt;Steve.Tom@eng.sun.com&gt;.
The idea is that you'll be able to choose between XView and Motif at compile
time (or, if you have both, at runtime.)  The Motif interface will become part
of the standard source distribution when it's ready.

<p>
<hr align=center width="50%">

<h3><a name="memory">Why does it eat more and more memory as it runs?</a></h3>

<p>
There is a bug in XView 3.0 (fixed in 3.0.1 and higher) that causes the
library to lose a little bit of memory whenever an image is destroyed.
Unfortunately, this happens twice a second while the About popup is
displayed.  If the About popup is left up overnight, the program can get
bigger than you might expect.  WorkMan doesn't update the About popup
unless it's actually displayed onscreen, so unpin (dismiss) it when
you're not using it and the program will stop growing.

<h2>Database Questions</h2>

<h3><a name="combine">How do I label several tracks in a row as part of the
same song?</a></h3>

<p>
There are several special symbols you can put into a track title to alter
aspects of the main window's display.  The most important is "//" (two
forward slashes in a row.)  This splits the title up into segments.  Usually,
each segment is displayed on its own line in the main window; a common use
is to enter titles that are too big to fit on one line.  For instance,
you might enter a title like:

<blockquote>
The really really really really really//really really really long song
</blockquote>

<p>
That would add a second line of track title information to the main window,
with the text after the "//"; the text before "//" would go on the first
line of the window.  The "//" itself is never displayed.  If you leave out
the "//" and just enter the long song title, the program will do its best
to break the title into separate segments automatically.

<p>
If a segment starts with "+", the rest of the text in the segment is displayed
in place of the disc name on the main window.  This is most often used when
several tracks are related in some way (such as movements of a symphony.)
For example, you might enter:

<blockquote>
+Symphony No. 2, op. 40//Allegro assai
</blockquote>

<p>
That title line has two segments.  The second segment is displayed as the
track title.  Since the first segment begins with "+", the CD's title is
replaced with "Symphony No. 2, op. 40" while the track in question is
playing.

<p>
As a shortcut, if a segment contains only a "+" character and nothing
else, the "+" segment from the previous track is used.  So you might
have a group of tracks labeled:

<blockquote>
+Piano concerto in G//Allegro<br>
+//Andante<br>
Presto//+<br>
+//Allegro assai - Andante -//Moderato marcato
</blockquote>

<p>
The third line is to demonstrate that the order of segments isn't important;
"+" can come anywhere.  The fourth track has the "Piano concerto in G"
title, as well as a two-line track title.

<p>
If you're not sure what the result will look like when you enter a
title with several segments, just click on the track's selector button
on the main window and the title will be displayed, even if the CD isn't
playing.

<p>
<hr align=center width="50%">

<h3><a name="artists">Can different tracks be by different artists?</a></h3>

<p>
Yes, using the same facilities described
<a href="#combine">above.</a>
There is a second
special character that can come at the front of a segment, "@".  It causes
the artist name on the main window display to be replaced with the rest of
the text in the segment while the track in question is playing.

<p>
"@" behaves in much the same way as "+" (e.g. if it's alone in a segment,
the previous track's "@" segment is used.)

<p>
A compilation CD's track titles might look like this:

<blockquote>
@Charles Gounod//+Ballet music from "Faust"//Allegretto<br>
@//+//Adagio<br>
@//+//Allegretto<br>
@//+//Moderato maestoso<br>
@//+//Moderato con moto<br>
@//+//Allegretto<br>
@//+//Allegro vivo<br>
@Friedrich Smetana//Symphonic poem "The Moldau"<br>
@Anton Dvorak//Slavonic Dance No. 2 in E minor<br>
@Adolphe Adam//Overture from "If I were King"
</blockquote>

<p>
<hr align=center width="50%">

<h3><a name="typing">Why do I have to type all that information in?  Isn't it
on the CD?</a></h3>

<p>
Nope.  It isn't.  The MiniDisc format from Sony puts track information on
the disc, but regular CDs don't contain a human-readable table of contents.
So until WorkMan is extended to support MiniDisc players, you're stuck
typing names in.

<p>
<hr align=center width="50%">

<h3><a name="nearmiss">Why doesn't WorkMan recognize a CD I know is in the
database?</a></h3>

<p>
Sometimes you'll put in a CD, and the program won't recognize it even
though you know you saw it in the database.  What's likely happening is
that you have a different pressing (publication run) of the CD than the
person who entered it into the database.  As I understand it, when they
want to make more copies of a CD, they produce a new pressing master from
the audio tape.  Unfortunately, the track timings are different by a
fraction of a second when they do that -- and since WorkMan uses track
timings (down to 1/75 of a second accuracy) to identify a CD, the new
pressing looks like a different disc.

<p>
A future version of the program will let you set a control to recognize
close matches; a popup saying "This CD could be XXX by XXX; is it?" will
appear.

<h2>Solaris-Specific Questions</h2>

<h3><a name="volmgr">It says "Device Busy" every time I try to start
it.</a></h3>

<p>
If you're running Solaris, you're trying to start WorkMan while "vold",
the Solaris volume manager, has control of the drive.  See the Solaris 2
<a href="notes-solaris2.html#volmgr">release notes</a>
for more information.


<p>
<hr size=3>
<h2>Linux-Specific Questions</h2>

<h3><a name="ide">Why doesn't it work with my IDE drive?</a></h3>

You probably had the <tt>-DLINUX_SCSI_PASSTHROUGH</tt> flag set in your
Makefile when you built WorkMan.  It tells WorkMan to try to send SCSI commands
to the drive directly rather than going through the OS-specific CD-ROM library
functions.  Unfortunately, that doesn't work on non-SCSI drives.

<p>
If you recompile WorkMan without that option, it ought to work better.

<p>
<hr align=center width="50%">

<h3><a name="linux">Where to go for more help</a></h3>

If you have problems not covered here, your best bet is to ask on
<a href="news:comp.os.linux.misc">comp.os.linux.misc</a>
unless you're pretty sure it's a generic problem with WorkMan and not
something Linux-specific.
I don't have a Linux system, and I don't really know much about Linux; most
WorkMan problems are pretty hardware- and OS-specific, and I'm not really
of much help to Linux users.

<p>
If you find an answer to your problem, though, by all means tell me about
it so I can add it to this page and save someone else some time.
