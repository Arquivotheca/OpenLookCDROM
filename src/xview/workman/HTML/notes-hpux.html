<p>
Note: Hewlett Packard supplies this without warranty or support of any kind.

<p>
WorkMan was ported to HPUX by John Brezak (brezak@apollo.hp.com).

<h2><a name="pre">Prerequisites</a></h2>

<p>
This program should compile and run on series 700 machines under HPUX 8.07
or higher.

<p>
You will need the XView toolkit, version 3.0 or higher.  An HPUX port of
XView is available from many sites via anonymous ftp.  Use archie to find
one near you.  Neither John nor I can supply people with XView sources, so
please don't ask.  ftp.csc.liv.ac.uk is one place you'll find XView for the
HP, though I'm sure they'd appreciate it if you tried to find a closer site
before using theirs.

<p>
There is a WorkMan binary at ftp.hyperion.com:/WorkMan/hp700.tar.Z if you
can't find XView or don't want to bother installing it.

<p>
You may also need to install the OPEN LOOK fonts to use this program.
They are available from ftp.hyperion.com as well as with the generic XView
source distribution, available widely in the contrib section of X11R5.
You do not need to build XView from source to get the fonts from the
source distribution.  They're included in the XView tarfiles on
ftp.csc.liv.ac.uk.

<p>
The supplied Makefile (Makefile.hpux) will need to be tweaked to point to
your XView include files and libraries.  You might also be able to generate
a valid Makefile with "imake".  I haven't tested that.

<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>

<p>
You'll want to put the following in your X resources:

<blockquote>
	openWindows.windowColor:        #CCCCCC
</blockquote>

<p>
Make "/dev/rscsi" a link to the CD-ROM's raw disk device.  For instance,
if your CD-ROM drive is at SCSI target number 2, you'd do (as root):

<blockquote>
	ln -s /dev/rdsk/c201d2s0 /dev/rscsi
</blockquote>

<p>
Or, if you prefer, use the "-c" option when running the program to tell
it to use a device name other than /dev/rscsi.

<p>
To use the program's spot help, you'll need to define a Help key, since
there isn't one on the HP keyboard.  Use the "xmodmap" program to do it.
For instance, the following will define the numeric keypad's "0" key as
the help key:

<blockquote>
	xmodmap -e "keysym KP_0 = Help"
</blockquote>

<p>
Once you have a Help key defined, position the mouse pointer over a control
and hit the key.  For this to work, you will either need to install the
"workman.info" file in /usr/lib/help or set your HELPPATH environment
variable to point to the directory where the .info file lives.

<p>
For those who'd like to read through the source, note that the HPUX-specific
code is contained in plat_hpux.c.

<p>
The authoritative guide to controlling the HP CD-ROM drive (which is actually
a Toshiba XM3301) is the Toshiba XM3301 User's Manual.  If you want to look
at it, contact Toshiba.

<h2><a name="problems">HP-specific Problems</a></h2>

<p>
When there's no CD in the drive, WorkMan is very slow.  As far as I can tell,
this is a hardware limitation -- the drive takes a long time to respond when
there's no CD present, and WorkMan is stuck waiting for the response in the
meantime.  If anyone knows a workaround, please get in touch with me.  You
can run with "-ee" if you find this behavior annoying (see the man page).

<p>
The mwm window manager (a derivative of which is used as the VUE window
manager) chops off part of the WorkMan icon.  This is an mwm problem; I'm
not aware that there's anything I can do to tell mwm to give the icon more
room.
