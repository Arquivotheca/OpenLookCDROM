<h1>Linux install notes</h1>

<p>
The devicename for the CD-ROM drive defaults to /dev/sr0; if needed, this can
be overridden by a command-line switch. See the manual page.

<p>
For WorkMan to function you will need a kernel-supported CD-ROM drive
which uses the Sun-style ioctls for audio control. Currently, there are
three options: I have implemented these functions for SCSI-2 CD-ROM drives;
the patches for this can be found in a misc. SCSI patches release by
Eric Youngdale: look on tsx-11.mit.edu:pub/linux/. These patches are known
to work with a Sony CDU-541 drive.

<p>
The other two options are the Sony CDU-31A and CDU-535/531 drives with their
special interfaces. Drivers for these drives, written by Corey Minyard and
RONJ.AN@site007.saic.com (Jeppesen, Ronald), respectively, can be found at
sunsite.unc.edu and tsx-11.mit.edu.

<p>
You can also use WorkMan's SCSI passthrough code, enabled by defining
LINUX_SCSI_PASSTHROUGH at compile time.  This will cause WorkMan to send
SCSI-2 audio commands directly to the drive rather than going through the
Sun-style audio ioctls.

<p>
Do <em>not</em> use LINUX_SCSI_PASSTHROUGH if you have an IDE drive -- it
won't work!

<p>
You will need the X libraries
and the XView3L3 package (look on sunsite). *IMPORTANT:* the included
Makefile.linux should work. *DO NOT* run xmkmf unless you know that you have
the OpenWindows .tmpl files. As far as I know, they are *NOT* in the XView3L3
package... At least I don't have them.  (They are reportedly in the XView3L5
package, but you need to run "imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/X386/lib/X11/config
-I/usr/openwin/lib/config" instead of xmkmf.)

<p>
If you want to use the online help, you'll need to pick a key to act as the
XView "Help" key, since PC keyboards don't tend to have Help keys.  F1 is a
typical choice.  Tell the X server about it with xmodmap, like:

<blockquote>
<code>xmodmap -e "keysym F1 = Help"</code>
</blockquote>

You'll also have to install the workman.info file in the right place as
described in the Makefile.

<p>
WorkMan was ported to Linux by Chris Newbold
&lt;newbie@inmet.camb.inmet.com&gt;, who seems to have disappeared from the
net; if anyone knows where he is (and he is still interested in helping out
with WorkMan on Linux) please
<a href="mailto:koreth@hyperion.com">let me know.</a>

<p>
Also let me know if you have anything to add to these install instructions;
I don't have a Linux system so none of the above is firsthand information.
