<h1>OSF/1 notes</h1>

<p>
This release contains preliminary support for OSF/1.  There are still
problems and unsupported features, but the idea is that putting out this
buggy version will motivate someone to fix what's wrong.  I don't have
any OSF/1 boxes so I can't look at it myself.

<p>
If you use something other than the provided Makefile.osf1, note that you
must define the "OSF1" macro in your cc options or the OSF/1 platform module
won't compile.

<p>
Excerpted from a mail message from R.J. Edwards, who did the port:

<blockquote>
I was able to port workman to a DEC alpha OSF/1 v1.2 machine today.
I had trouble with imake/xmkmf.  In the Makefile I had to change INCDIR
and LIBDIR to point to my xview directories.

<p>
I still have to specify my drive name with the -c option and it will bomb
out if there's no cd in it. The volume controls don't work and I can't
eject w/o terminating workman and doing it manually. These problems are
probably due to using the ultrix platform and not doing the work necessary
for the OSF/1 platform.
