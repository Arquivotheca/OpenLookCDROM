<h1>BSD/386 notes</h1>

<p>
WorkMan was ported to BSD/386 by John Kohl
(<a href="mailto:jtk@kolvir.blrc.ma.us">jtk@kolvir.blrc.ma.us</a>).

<p>
To compile and run WorkMan on BSD/386, you will need two things not
provided in the BSD/386 release:

<ol>
   <li> XView libraries and include files (3.0 or later), available on
	<a href="ftp://bsdi.com/contrib/X11">bsdi.com</a> for anonymous FTP.

   <li> <a href="patch-bsd386">Diffs</a> for the CDROM library (to provide a
	volume function with better resolution.)  These are in the file
	<code>patch-bsd386</code> in the WorkMan source's <code>html</code>
	directory.
</ol>

<p>
If you have a SoundBlaster Pro with a driver installed (also available
from bsdi.com, the SBlast-1.5 version, not Steve McCanne's version), you
can compile SoundBlaster volume control code, which is useful for
non-SCSI CDROM devices.  To do so, edit the Imakefile to remove the
comments around LOCALDEFS.  Once you have compiled, you can enable the
SoundBlaster volume control by patching the sb_fd variable to -1, like
so:

<blockquote>
% /usr/bin/gdb -w workman<br>
(gdb) set sb_fd = -1<br>
(gdb) quit<br>
%
</blockquote>

<p>
Use imake to generate a BSD/386 Makefile, with something like:

<blockquote>
imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/src/local/XView3.0/config -I/usr/X11/lib/X11/config
</blockquote>

<p>
For SCSI CD-ROM drives, WorkMan must be run as root (perhaps as setuid,
but that may have security implications on database file reading) in
order to have access to issue SCSI audio commands.
