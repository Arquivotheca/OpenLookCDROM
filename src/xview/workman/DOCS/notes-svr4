   This doesn't apply to Solaris 2, which has its own page.
   
   WorkMan was ported to SVR4 by Baruch Cochavy (bcochavy@iil.intel.com).
   
   
   WorkMan needs to be installed suid root. That's because the kernel
   allow pass-through device open to root only, no matter what the
   permissions are.
   
   The build process should be done in two parts; first, as a normal
   user, do
   
     mv Makefile.svr4 Makefile ; make
     
   Then, su to root, and do make root. This may be followed by make
   install, still as root (or any other uid that can write to the
   destination directory).
   
   Note that the first time WorkMan is used, a pass-through node will be
   created. This node will be owned by root, and will belong to group
   root as well. This is needed to provide access control to the CD
   device under WorkMan.
   
   For example, if the CD-ROM device is /dev/rcdrom/cd0, WorkMan will
   create /dev/rcdrom/cd0p. Note that this is the default name for
   WorkMan on SVR4.
   
   Complied using GCC 2.4.5, using XFree86-1.2 and accompanying OpenLook
   so called 'extra' distribution. Does not seem to suffer the memory
   leak bug in the 'about' popup.
   
   Works on SVR 4.0 4.0 and Toshiba 3401B CD-ROM drive.
