Compiling WorkMan for Solaris 2

   
   
   WorkMan should compile without modification on Solaris 2.x, provided
   you make sure the three relevant lines indicated in the Makefile are
   uncommented. The LIBLOC line is necessary to get it to run properly in
   conjunction with the volume manager (vold) found in Solaris 2.2 and
   later.
   
   If you're using the SPARCworks compilers from Sun, make sure your
   search path is set so that "/opt/SUNWspro/bin" (or whatever directory
   the compilers are in) is searched before "/usr/ucb". Otherwise you'll
   be using a different set of libraries and include files, and WorkMan
   won't compile properly.
   
   If you get a message like "language optional software package not
   installed," your machine probably does not have SPARCworks, and you
   should talk to your system administrator about getting gcc.
   
Using gcc

   
   
   You should be able to compile WorkMan using gcc. Just uncomment the
   "CC=gcc" line in the Makefile and comment out (or remove) "CC=cc".
   
   Gcc version 2.6.0 is known to compile WorkMan on Solaris 2.4 without
   any special handholding; older versions of Solaris and/or gcc
   apparently have some trouble with the include files in
   /usr/openwin/include. If you get compiler errors about OpenWindows
   include files, you should probably run the "fixincludes" utility that
   comes with gcc, giving it the correct command line arguments so it
   fixes /usr/openwin/include.
   
Using the volume manager

   
   
   If you're running the volume manager -- you probably are -- you can
   get it to start WorkMan when you insert a music CD. Assuming you've
   installed WorkMan in /usr/openwin/bin, add the following line to
   /etc/rmmount.conf, before the action_filemgr line:
   
     action cdrom action_workman.so /usr/openwin/bin/workman
     
   
   
   You should already have "action_workman.so" -- it comes with Solaris.
   With that line in place, a WorkMan window should appear on your screen
   when you insert a CD.
   
   Note that the volume manager doesn't know whether you're running a
   window system, so if you put in a music CD when you're not running
   OpenWindows (or there's one in the drive when the system boots up)
   you'll have to eject it with the "eject" command and reinsert it to
   get the WorkMan window to appear.
   
   Also, WorkMan will be running as root or as nobody, not as you, since
   the volume manager runs without regard to who happens to be logged in
   on the console. As a result, you'll probably want to edit your
   .Xdefaults file and add the "workman.db.shared" and
   "workman.db.personal" resources to tell WorkMan where to find its
   database files. For example, if /users/jane is your home directory,
   you'd probably add:
   
     workman.db.shared: /users/jane/.workmandb
     workman.db.personal: /users/jane/.workmanrc
     
   
   
   Then run "xrdb -merge $HOME/.Xdefaults" to load the new settings into
   your X server. You should only have to run that command once;
   .Xdefaults is read automatically when you start the window system.
   
   If you do use the volume manager to start WorkMan, you may find you
   have to run "xhost hostname" (where hostname is the name of your
   machine) to give root-owned processes the right to connect to your X
   server.
   
   You'll also find that setting environment variables has no effect on
   WorkMan when it's started by the volume manager, even if you set them
   before you start the window system. To see why, realize that
   environment variables are inherited by new processes from their
   parents. The volume manager is started at system boot time, before
   you've logged in; it's what runs WorkMan, so WorkMan only gets
   whatever variables were set when vold was started. Setting variables
   in your .cshrc, or manually in a window, does not magically cause them
   to be set in preexisting processes or those processes' children.
   
Avoiding the volume manager

   If all that sounds too confusing and you'd like to avoid the volume
   manager altogether, you can start WorkMan by hand as long as you do it
   after you've inserted a CD.
   
Getting audio output from the workstation

   (Note: This section only applies to the SPARCstation 5, and possibly
   the 20. On other machines, hook up a cable from the CD player's
   headphone jack to the computer's microphone input.)
   
   Version 1.3 of WorkMan adds code to control the audio hardware on the
   SS5. It only works if there is a physical connection inside the
   machine between the CD player's internal audio output and the internal
   audio input on the workstation. Instructions for making that
   connection are included with the CD-ROM drive; don't ask me.
   
   The code was added by <stevep@ctc.ih.att.com>, who has this to say:
   
     I'm sure there will be problems with it, as people use hardware
     configurations I didn't imagine. I'll be happy to try to deal with
     them.
     
     The use of audiocontrol, audiotool, gaintool, or the like in
     conjunction with this is highly recommended. Upon initialization, it
     switches the codec input to the internal CD player, and turns the
     monitor gain up to full (necessary). Thereafter, anytime WorkMan
     begins a play operation, it checks the state of the codec and
     enforces the following conditions:
     
     channels: 2
     encoding: linear
     precision: 16 bits
     sample rate: 44100
     monitor gain: max
     input port: internal cd player
     
     It does NOT "own" /dev/audio, nor does it check state other than
     when beginning a "play". This allows other processes to do things
     with the audio system. Please note that most other things will leave
     the chip in a relatively pathetic state (8-bit ulaw mono at 8000
     samples/sec); pausing and resuming will correct this.
     
     This all comes about because the headphone jack on the CD drawer
     sounds awful (lots of processor noise; apparently, Sun doesn't
     believe in shielding). The headphone jack out the back sounds MUCH
     better, but one has to go through the audio chip to get there.
     
   
   
   Please send mail directly to him if you have problems with this aspect
   of WorkMan.
