                            HOW TO INSTALL WORKMAN
                                       
Prerequisites

   
   
   WorkMan requires XView version 3 or higher. This is supplied by
   default on Sun systems (though you may have to select the "OpenWindows
   Developers" category from your SunOS or Solaris CD to get the
   necessary files for compiling) and is available as part of the
   "contrib" distribution in X11R5 and X11R6 for other systems.
   
   Some of the Makefiles assume that OPENWINHOME is set to the Sun
   OpenWindows 3.x home directory. Some tweaking will probably be
   required if you're not using OpenWindows; OPENWINHOME is used to
   locate the XView include files and libraries.
   
Building

   
   
   How you build WorkMan depends on which platform you're trying to build
   it on. The following are the quick-and-dirty instructions, and will
   often suffice, but you should follow the link on your platform's name
   for more information.
   
   On most platforms, you can configure WorkMan to use a database library
   from 4.4BSD to look CDs up very quickly. More details on that below.
   
   SunOS 4.x
          Edit "Makefile" and comment out the Solaris 2 lines (SOL2,
          LIBLOC, and EXTRA_LIBS). Then type "make". You may want to use
          the "-e" option when you run WorkMan; see the manpage.
          
   Solaris 2.x
          If you're not using gcc, adjust the Makefile accordingly. Then
          type "make".
          
   ULTRIX
          NEWS-OS
          BSD/386
          FreeBSD
          Run "imake" or "xmkmf" to convert the supplied Imakefile to a
          Makefile. Or edit the Makefile to point to the right
          directories.
          
   HP-UX
          Edit "Makefile.hpux" to point to the correct directories, then
          type "make -f Makefile.hpux" to build WorkMan. You may want to
          use the "-e" option when you run WorkMan; see the manpage.
          
   Linux
          Edit "Makefile.linux" to point to the correct directories.
          Uncomment the PASS line if appropriate (see the Makefile.) Then
          type "make -f Makefile.linux" to build WorkMan.
          
   SVr4 4.0
          Edit "Makefile.svr4" to point to the right directories, then
          type "make -f Makefile.svr4".
          
   OSF/1
          Note: OSF/1 is not officially supported; the code is known to
          have problems on many systems. Edit "Makefile.osf1" to point
          to the right directories, then type "make -f Makefile.osf1".
          Note that this port is preliminary and there are known problems
          (see README.osf1 for details).
          
  USING THE LIBDB PACKAGE
  
   WorkMan can optionally make use of the 4.4BSD "libdb" package to speed
   up database lookups tremendously. Here's how to use it.
    1. For now, you have to get libdb separately; it's available on
       ftp.cs.berkeley.edu in /ucb/4bsd.
    2. Unpack libdb in the WorkMan source directory. A subdirectory
       called "db.1.85" will be created.
    3. cd db.1.85/PORT
    4. Have a look at the README file if you like.
    5. There are a bunch of system-specific directories in PORT. Look for
       the system name that most closely resembles yours. Go into it.
    6. make
    7. Go back to the WorkMan source directory (cd ../../..).
    8. Edit your system's Makefile, or the Imakefile if that's what
       you're using. You'll see a comment about libdb; the lines below
       that define some compiler options and the path to the libdb
       library. Uncomment those lines and make sure the paths point to
       the PORT directory you built libdb in.
    9. make (with appropriate arguments, e.g. -f Makefile.linux, for your
       system.)
       
   
   
   If you have an old WorkMan database sitting around, you should build
   an index file for it; WorkMan itself only writes to the index file
   when you save or update a CD. There's a program called "buildindex" to
   build index files. Type "make buildindex" (specifying an alternate
   Makefile as appropriate) after you've built WorkMan. To run
   buildindex, just give it the path to your database file as an
   argument, e.g. "buildindex $HOME/.workmandb".
   
   One thing to be careful of is using libdb on a database you're sharing
   via NFS on a system without working file locking. If you run WorkMan
   with the "-n" option to bypass the file locking code, you risk
   corrupting the index file if two people save CDs at once. If you're
   the only one using a CD database, or the only one with write access to
   it, you can safely use -n in conjunction with libdb; it's only when
   two or more entries are saved simultaneously that problems can occur.
   In that case the best solution is to bug your sysadmin, or your UNIX
   vendor, to give you working file locking.
   
Installing

   
   
   Once the executable is built, install it in your favorite directory
   for such things. The file "workman.info" should be placed in the XView
   help directory, usually $OPENWINHOME/lib/help. If you put it somewhere
   else, be sure to set your HELPPATH environment variable to point to
   that directory. This is necessary if you want to use the Help key to
   see the controls' descriptions. Run "make install" to install
   everything under $OPENWINHOME. You will probably need to be root to do
   this.
   
   Once all that's done, you're ready to rock and roll (or jazz, or...)
