                               WHAT IS WORKMAN?
                                       
   
   
   WorkMan is a graphical tool for playing audio compact discs on a
   CD-ROM drive. It has most of the features available on standalone CD
   players, such as a shuffle mode, programmable playlists, and
   elapsed/remaining timers. But it also has extra features, foremost of
   which is the ability to store information about CDs in a database,
   then automatically extract that information when the CD is inserted
   later. WorkMan stores the artist's name, the disc title, the names of
   individual tracks, and even remembers which tracks you don't want to
   hear! All in an easy-to-use, attractive OPEN LOOK graphical interface.
   
   
   Disc databases may be shared among any number of users on the network.
   WorkMan keeps separate databases for your private information about
   CDs (e.g. which order you like the tracks to play) and the discs'
   public information. During WorkMan's alpha test, several users shared
   my database, which now contains over 1300 CDs. That database is
   available via anonymous ftp from ftp.hyperion.com in the "WorkMan"
   directory.
   
   WorkMan requires XView 3.0 or higher (which comes with the OpenWindows
   distribution, and is also available as part of X11R6.)
   
   The manual page (workman.man) contains a brief description of the user
   interface, though for the most part you should be able to start using
   the tool right away without reading the docs. If you're curious about
   the program's innards, the workmandb.man manual page describes the
   database file format.
