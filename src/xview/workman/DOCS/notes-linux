   The devicename for the CD-ROM drive defaults to /dev/sr0; if needed,
   this can be overridden by a command-line switch. See the manual page.
   
   For WorkMan to function you will need a kernel-supported CD-ROM drive
   which uses the Sun-style ioctls for audio control. Currently, there
   are three options: I have implemented these functions for SCSI-2
   CD-ROM drives; the patches for this can be found in a misc. SCSI
   patches release by Eric Youngdale: look on tsx-11.mit.edu:pub/linux/.
   These patches are known to work with a Sony CDU-541 drive.
   
   The other two options are the Sony CDU-31A and CDU-535/531 drives with
   their special interfaces. Drivers for these drives, written by Corey
   Minyard and RONJ.AN@site007.saic.com (Jeppesen, Ronald), respectively,
   can be found at sunsite.unc.edu and tsx-11.mit.edu.
   
   You can also use WorkMan's SCSI passthrough code, enabled by defining
   LINUX_SCSI_PASSTHROUGH at compile time. This will cause WorkMan to
   send SCSI-2 audio commands directly to the drive rather than going
   through the Sun-style audio ioctls.
   
   Do not use LINUX_SCSI_PASSTHROUGH if you have an IDE drive -- it won't
   work!
   
   You will need the X libraries and the XView3L3 package (look on
   sunsite). *IMPORTANT:* the included Makefile.linux should work. *DO
   NOT* run xmkmf unless you know that you have the OpenWindows .tmpl
   files. As far as I know, they are *NOT* in the XView3L3 package... At
   least I don't have them. (They are reportedly in the XView3L5 package,
   but you need to run "imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/X386/lib/X11/config
   -I/usr/openwin/lib/config" instead of xmkmf.)
   
   If you want to use the online help, you'll need to pick a key to act
   as the XView "Help" key, since PC keyboards don't tend to have Help
   keys. F1 is a typical choice. Tell the X server about it with xmodmap,
   like:
   
     xmodmap -e "keysym F1 = Help"
     
   You'll also have to install the workman.info file in the right place
   as described in the Makefile.
   
   WorkMan was ported to Linux by Chris Newbold
   <newbie@inmet.camb.inmet.com>, who seems to have disappeared from the
   net; if anyone knows where he is (and he is still interested in
   helping out with WorkMan on Linux) please let me know.
   
   Also let me know if you have anything to add to these install
   instructions; I don't have a Linux system so none of the above is
   firsthand information.
