   WorkMan was ported to NEWS-OS 6.0 by Tatsuo Nagamatsu,
   nagamatu@sm.sony.co.jp. It requires the XView toolkit version 3.0 or
   higher.
   
   To compile, use "xmkmf" or "imake" to generate a Makefile from the
   included Imakefile. Then type "make" and everything should compile.
   
   If additional steps are required, please let me know so I can update
   this file.
