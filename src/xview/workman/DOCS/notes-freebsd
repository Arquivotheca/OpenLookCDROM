   WorkMan was ported to FreeBSD by Todd Pfaff
   (todd@flex.eng.mcmaster.ca).
   
   This port was developed and tested on the following:
     * FreeBSD-1.1-BETA
     * XFree86-2.0
     * xview3.2 (from the FreeBSD ports collection)
     * Adaptec 1542C SCSI controller
     * Toshiba XM-3401B CDROM drive
       
Building from source

   If you have FreeBSD-1.1, XFree86-2.0 and xview3.2 installed you should
   be able to build and install workman with:
   
     xmkmf
     make
     make install
     make install.man
     
Known problems

   All CD drive IO is done using the FreeBSD CDIO interface defined in
   cdio.h. I didn't attempt to write the wm_scsi() SCSI interface code in
   plat_freebsd.c so direct SCSI support is not available. Implementing
   this would allow the SCSI drive specific routines from drv_*.c to be
   taken advantage of. Perhaps the SCSI user library submitted to the
   FreeBSD-hackers list by Peter Dufault (hd@world.std.com) could be used
   for this purpose.
   
   The CDIOREADTOCENTRYS fails if an attempt is made to read past the
   last track found with CDIOREADTOCHEADER and I couldn't figure out any
   way to get the length of the last CD track. If anyone fixes this
   please let me know how. I hardcoded the last track length as 10
   minutes which is obviously an ugly solution.
   
   The CDIOCEJECT ioctl doesn't eject the CD from my drive.
   
   The volume control isn't the greatest and I didn't spend any time
   trying to improve it.
   
   The balance control doesn't work very well.
