   Note: Hewlett Packard supplies this without warranty or support of any
   kind.
   
   WorkMan was ported to HPUX by John Brezak (brezak@apollo.hp.com).
   
Prerequisites

   
   
   This program should compile and run on series 700 machines under HPUX
   8.07 or higher.
   
   You will need the XView toolkit, version 3.0 or higher. An HPUX port
   of XView is available from many sites via anonymous ftp. Use archie to
   find one near you. Neither John nor I can supply people with XView
   sources, so please don't ask. ftp.csc.liv.ac.uk is one place you'll
   find XView for the HP, though I'm sure they'd appreciate it if you
   tried to find a closer site before using theirs.
   
   There is a WorkMan binary at ftp.hyperion.com:/WorkMan/hp700.tar.Z if
   you can't find XView or don't want to bother installing it.
   
   You may also need to install the OPEN LOOK fonts to use this program.
   They are available from ftp.hyperion.com as well as with the generic
   XView source distribution, available widely in the contrib section of
   X11R5. You do not need to build XView from source to get the fonts
   from the source distribution. They're included in the XView tarfiles
   on ftp.csc.liv.ac.uk.
   
   The supplied Makefile (Makefile.hpux) will need to be tweaked to point
   to your XView include files and libraries. You might also be able to
   generate a valid Makefile with "imake". I haven't tested that.
   
Usage

   
   
   You'll want to put the following in your X resources:
   
     openWindows.windowColor: #CCCCCC
     
   
   
   Make "/dev/rscsi" a link to the CD-ROM's raw disk device. For
   instance, if your CD-ROM drive is at SCSI target number 2, you'd do
   (as root):
   
     ln -s /dev/rdsk/c201d2s0 /dev/rscsi
     
   
   
   Or, if you prefer, use the "-c" option when running the program to
   tell it to use a device name other than /dev/rscsi.
   
   To use the program's spot help, you'll need to define a Help key,
   since there isn't one on the HP keyboard. Use the "xmodmap" program to
   do it. For instance, the following will define the numeric keypad's
   "0" key as the help key:
   
     xmodmap -e "keysym KP_0 = Help"
     
   
   
   Once you have a Help key defined, position the mouse pointer over a
   control and hit the key. For this to work, you will either need to
   install the "workman.info" file in /usr/lib/help or set your HELPPATH
   environment variable to point to the directory where the .info file
   lives.
   
   For those who'd like to read through the source, note that the
   HPUX-specific code is contained in plat_hpux.c.
   
   The authoritative guide to controlling the HP CD-ROM drive (which is
   actually a Toshiba XM3301) is the Toshiba XM3301 User's Manual. If you
   want to look at it, contact Toshiba.
   
HP-specific Problems

   
   
   When there's no CD in the drive, WorkMan is very slow. As far as I can
   tell, this is a hardware limitation -- the drive takes a long time to
   respond when there's no CD present, and WorkMan is stuck waiting for
   the response in the meantime. If anyone knows a workaround, please get
   in touch with me. You can run with "-ee" if you find this behavior
   annoying (see the man page).
   
   The mwm window manager (a derivative of which is used as the VUE
   window manager) chops off part of the WorkMan icon. This is an mwm
   problem; I'm not aware that there's anything I can do to tell mwm to
   give the icon more room.
