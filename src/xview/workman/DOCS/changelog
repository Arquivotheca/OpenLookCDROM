Release 1.3

   
   
   All the documentation is now in HTML format, for (theoretically)
   easier navigation than poring through a bunch of text files. It's also
   online on www.hyperion.com, which is the real benefit; you can jump
   straight to the latest copies of everything.
   
   Experimental support for fast database lookups using the Berkeley
   libdb code. Libdb is available on ftp.cs.berkeley.edu in /ucb/4bsd.
   See the master Makefile for details if you don't see any mention of
   libdb in your system's Makefile. You'll want to make "buildindex" and
   run it over your existing database files to index what's there
   already. That functionality might be moved into WorkMan at some point.
   
   
   Various bugfixes to the FreeBSD and OSF/1 ports by John Kohl
   <jtk@kolvir.blrc.ma.us>.
   
   On the SPARCstation 5 (and possibly 20), audio is now available
   through the computer's headphone jack if there is a connection between
   the CD-ROM drive's internal audio output and the computer's audio
   hardware. Thanks to <stevep@ctc.ih.att.com>.
   
   Volume control on the Toshiba 3501 is supported. Thanks to Greg Ames
   <tga@lorax.assabet.com>.
   
   The bitmap format was changed to be byte-order independent. Previous
   versions sometimes produced strange-looking controls on little-endian
   systems (e.g. Linux machines.) Thanks to Jean-Gabriel Dick
   <dick@amertume.ufr-info-p7.ibp.fr>.
   
   On ULTRIX, if the "CDROM" environment variable is set, it is used as
   the name of the CD-ROM device file, just like the "cdp" command-line
   tool. Thanks to Anthony Starks <anthony_starks@merck.com>.
   
   Updated README.solaris2 to be a bit more helpful, especially in
   regards to usage with the volume manager.
   
   The "back" button (the upper-left one) goes to the beginning of the
   track if the track has been playing for more than 2 seconds. If you're
   less than 2 seconds in, it goes to the previous track as before. You
   can change the threshold with the "workman.reverseThreshold" resource;
   set it to something high like 9999999 if you want the old behavior.
   
   Patched plat_hpux.c to work on HPUX 8.07 again (thanks to Henrique
   Jorge Fonseca <hjf@athena.inesc.pt>.)
   
   Fixed a problem with the usage message (thanks to Jeffery Small
   <quick.com!cjsa!jeff>.)
   
Release 1.2.2a (94/05/22)

   
   
   The speaker icon in the CD Info popup is now made of two panel items,
   one for the "None" message and one for the pictures. That should
   eliminate a problem with the XView 3.0 library on Linux systems (and
   possibly others.)
   
   Moved the window initialization code below the option parsing code.
   This should make "workman -s" a lot faster.
   
   Unknown status codes from the generic SCSI-2 module now cause the tool
   to think the CD is ejected.
   
   Merged in the FreeBSD port by Todd Pfaff <todd@flex.eng.mcmaster.ca>.
   
   Merged in a preliminary OSF/1 port by R.J. Edwards
   <rje@escact.ksc.nasa.gov>.
   
Release 1.2.1 (94/02/24)

   
   
   The vendor and model fields of the wm_drive structure were supposed to
   be arrays, not pointers. This caused buffer overruns and segmentation
   faults, and required the -fwritable-strings flag to be used when
   compiling with gcc. Oops!
   
   Added some code to scsi.c to handle a wider range of status codes from
   drives, which should make the program more robust on HP-UX and SVR4
   systems. Also added similar code to plat_sun.c.
   
   Added a note to the ANSWERS file about where to get the latest
   version.
   
Release 1.2 (94/01/29)

   
   
   Completely revamped the organization of system-dependent code,
   previously in hardware.c. Now there is a low level platform module for
   each supported machine type, and there can be drive modules for drives
   that don't respond to generic SCSI codes. This should make the program
   much more portable and enable it to support nonstandard drives. These
   changes should not affect things from the user's point of view at all
   (though they make user-visible changes possible, such as the next
   items.) See PORTING for more info.
   
   WorkMan now determines the current volume and balance settings at
   startup on the Sun CD drive. This renders the workman.initialVolume
   resource much less necessary, though it is still supported.
   
   The Toshiba XM3301 and XM3401 drives are supported directly. Mainly
   this means that the volume knob on Sun systems will alter the volume
   on those drives, and that volume control is now supported under HP-UX.
   
   
   Merged in BSD/386 port by John T. Kohl <jtk@kolvir.blrc.ma.us>. Part
   of the port was making cur_cdmode an enumerated type rather than an
   int, which will hopefully make the code more readable.
   
   Merged in SVR4 4.0 port by Baruch Cochavy <bcochavy@iil.intel.com>.
   
   Made special note of the XView "-scale" command-line argument in the
   manpage.
   
   Added the workman.autoPlay resource. If it's set to "always", WorkMan
   will always play CDs when they're inserted. If it's "never", WorkMan
   will never autoplay a cd, regardless of settings in the .workmanrc
   file. The default setting is "normal", which uses .workmanrc to
   determine whether or not to autoplay.
   
   If there was a big enough hole at the start of the .workmanrc file,
   after the global settings, and the Play Unknown CDs mode was selected,
   new entries weren't being written to .workmanrc.
   
   On Suns, the status indicators would stop updating sometimes. This was
   due to a workaround for a volume manager problem. The workaround is
   more careful now and the status indicators shouldn't stop any more.
   
Release 1.1 (93/11/24)

   
   
   Added small icons for the main panel controls (stop, play, etc.),
   which looks much better with -scale small, and better with -scale
   normal. The big icons are used with -scale large and -scale
   extra_large. This is determined by font size and controlled by a
   resource as described below.
   
   WorkMan now reads X resources (finally!) to control certain behavior.
   The resources are as follows: workman.smallButtons If true, use small
   (16x16) icons for the main panel buttons. If false, use the old 32x16
   icons. If undefined, the program will try to use the right size
   depending on how big the rest of the window is. workman.db.personal
   workman.db.shared These are just like the WORKMANRC and WORKMANDB
   environment variables, respectively; the resources override the
   variables. Use these to set database locations if you're using the
   Solaris 2.2 volume manager to start WorkMan. workman.initialVolume A
   percentage value indicating how high the volume should be set when
   WorkMan starts up.
   
   New -D option allows specification of shared database location(s) on
   the command line. Overrides environment variable and resource
   settings.
   
   Merged in Sony NEWS-OS port by Tatsuo Nagamatsu
   (nagamatu@sm.sony.co.jp).
   
   The -c option now works even if find_cdrom() doesn't (mainly affects
   ULTRIX)
   
   Database files can't be directories or devices or pipes.
   
   The track listing in the CD Info popup should be lined up properly
   when using monospaced fonts now. Alexander Dupuy
   (dupuy@tiemann.cs.columbia.edu)
   
   New -C option forces the CD device to be closed after each eject,
   mostly for my flaky Sun CD drive which needs power cycling every so
   often.
   
   Split the HPUX SCSI definitions into a separate headerfile, and made
   some other changes, to make hardware.c a little more readable.
   
   Moved some code around in workman_stubs.c to make it more readable.
   
   Fixed a bug that caused WorkMan to crash if you used "@//" in a track
   title when the previous track didn't have the artist redefined.
   
   Some tweaks to database.c for use in the repository server.
   
   hardware.c was missing an include file on Solbourne machines.
   
   Changed the binary search algorithm in unscale_volume() so it can
   reach full volume no matter what the maximum value is.
   
   The program now has minimal functionality under ULTRIX 4.3. Further
   support may be added in a future release (and patches are, of course,
   welcome.)
   
   Changes to workman_stubs.c and hardware.c for Linux compatibility.
   
Release 1.0.2 (93/06/12)

   
   
   Fixed a database-writing bug. WorkMan didn't always fill up available
   holes with entries that were small enough.
   
   Added three new signals to control WorkMan from the command line.
   SIGTTIN goes back one track, SIGTTOU goes forward one track, and
   SIGEMT ejects the CD.
   
   Added a "-s" option to send signals to a running WorkMan. Valid
   parameters are back, play (or "go"), fwd, pause (or "mute"), stop, and
   eject. The first letter of a command may be used (except pause and
   play, which require two letters.)
   
   Added support for the Solaris 2.2 volume manager. The program will now
   locate and use the correct device on Sun systems (it tries
   /vol/dev/aliases/cdrom0, /dev/rdsk/c0t6d0s2, and /dev/rsr0, in that
   order) regardless of which OS version it was compiled under. You
   should be able to share a SunOS 4.x binary with Solaris 2.x systems
   without worrying about device names. If the "eject" program is used to
   eject the CD, the volume manager will spit out a message about loading
   an unnamed CD into the drive; there's nothing WorkMan can do about the
   message, as far as I can tell. This change shouldn't affect systems
   other than Suns, although some code was reorganized slightly.
   
   Eliminated Solaris 2.x compiler warnings in hardware.c and display.c.
   
   Eliminated compiler warnings resulting from returning NULL from an int
   function. Patch supplied by lingy@rpi.edu.
   
Release 1.0.1 (93/03/04)

   
   
   Support for Linux systems added.
   
Release 1.0 (92/12/24)

   
   
   Rearranged the manual page to make it more useful.
