# 
:controls1
Welcome to WorkMan!  This program has everything,
including the kitchen sink.
# 
:tracknames
The CD's creator, the name of the CD, and the
name of the current track are displayed here.
Click on "CD Info..." to set or change the CD`s
information.
# 
:tracks
Use this display to select a track to play.  It
also indicates the current track while in play
mode.
# 
:tracktimer
The amount of time the current track has been
playing.
# 
:songpos
This indicates how far into the track you are, as
well as allowing you to skip to different places
in the track by moving the slider to the desired
location.
# 
:tracklen
This display is the length of the current track,
in minutes and seconds.
# 
:speaker
A cute little picture of no consequence; ignore it.
# 
:repeat
This item controls what Workman does when the CD
is done playing.  If it's set to "Stop," the CD
will stop; this is the default behavior.  Setting
this to "Repeat" will cause the CD to start
playing again (using a different track ordering if
in shuffle mode.)  Setting this to "Eject" tells
Workman to eject the CD when it's done playing.
Click on the box to cycle through the choices.
# 
:mode
The main control panel.  The controls mean:

Previous   Play     Next
Pause      Stop     Eject

"Previous" and "Next" go to the next track on the
playlist, if any, and follow the track ordering
correctly in shuffle mode.  In normal mode, they
go to the current track minus or plus 1,
respectively.
# 
:volume
This slider controls the volume level of the CD. 
The top of the scale is loudest; the bottom is
silent.
# 
:shuffle
Click here to cycle through the three play modes:
normal, shuffle, and playlist.  Normal mode plays
the CD from start to end, minus any tracks you've
indicated you don't want to hear (see the CD Info
popup.)  Shuffle mode plays the tracks in a random
order, avoids tracks you don't want to hear, and
plays continuation tracks in the right order
(again, see CD Info.)  Playlist mode plays tracks
listed in the Play List section of the CD Info
popup.
# 
:cdtimer
The current position on the CD in minutes and
seconds.  Also an elapsed time meter, if the CD is
playing in Normal mode.
# 
:cdlen
This value is the length of the entire CD, in
minutes and seconds.
# 
:cdgauge
This indicator shows the time elapsed and total
play time of the CD.
# 
:button3
Bring up the About popup, which contains the
credits and a couple dumb pictures.
# 
:button2
Bring up the CD Info popup, into which you can
enter information about the CD in the drive.  This
button also removes the popup when you're done
with it.
# 
:button4
Pop up or dismiss the Goodies popup, which
contains infrequently-used controls of dubious
value.
# 
:controls2
This popup contains information about the CD in
the drive.  Help is available for each of the
individual controls.  If your window manager
doesn't let you dismiss popups, you can dismiss
this popup by pressing the CD Info button in the
main window again.
# 
:artist
The name of the music's creator (Rolling Stones,
Pierne, Count Basie, etc.)
# 
:cdname
The name of the album or disc.
# 
:tracklist
This is a list of the tracks on the CD.  To enter
names for the tracks, select the first track from
the list and move the cursor down to the "Name:"
field under the list (you'll probably want to type
in the artist and name of the disc above.)  Enter
the name of the track and hit Return; the next
track will be selected, and you may enter its name
as well.
# 
:trackname
The individual song name of this track.  "//" may
be used to split a title up into multiple lines.
If a line starts with "+", the CD title display is
temporarily replaced with the rest of the line (up
to the next // or end of title) while that track
is playing.  Starting a line with "@" does the
same for the artist.  For example, a title like
"@Mozart//+Operas//The Magic Flute//Allegro" would
replace the artist display with "Mozart," the CD
title with "Operas," and display a two-line track
title with "The Magic Flute" above "Allegro". 
Neither + nor @ will affect the real CD title or
artist; they are useful for compilation CDs and
the like.  If @ or + is followed by // or is at
the end of the title, the artist or CD name of the
previous track is used.  For example, the second
movement of a symphony might be named "+//Adagio".
# 
:trackoptions
If the "Continuation" box is checked, the selected
track is a continuation of the previous one (e.g.
the second movement of a symphony.)  Shuffle mode
won't start on a continuation track.  If the
"Don't play" box is checked, the selected track
will not be played unless it's specifically
selected in the player's main window.
# 
:whichvolume
You may set the default volume for the entire CD,
or for individual tracks (which you can select
using the scrolling list above.)
# 
:defaultvolume
Use this slider to set the default volume for the
CD or for individual tracks.  If the slider is
moved all the way to the left, there is no default
volume and the setting on the main panel will be
used when this CD is inserted.
# 
:defaultspeaker
A silly little picture of no consequence (most of
the time.)  Marvel at it or ignore it.
# 
:playmode
This choice item chooses the play mode which will
be selected when this CD is inserted next time.
# 
:autoplay
If selected, this CD will be played automatically
when it's inserted.
# 
:button1
Save this CD to the database.  Information such as
artist and track names is saved.  This button also
saves some global settings, such as the stop mode
from the main window.
# 
:button8
Undo all changes to the current CD's information,
including playlists, track titles, etc.
# 
:buttonpl
Click this button to display (and dismiss) the
popup window that contains the controls for
building playlists.
# 
:controls3
If you need help with this popup, you need help.

while, so be patient.
