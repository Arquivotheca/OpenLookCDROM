<BODY><H1>FacMan - SVR4 "facility" switch</H1>
<P>This program is <EM>incomplete</EM>
It will, when finished, allow SVR4 users (including Solaris 2 and
maybe by then Linux) to turn facilities like LP, Volume Management, etc.,
on or off either for now or permanently, by starting/stopping them
and/or linking them/removing them into /etc/rc?.d/*.
