This file attempts to assist in the conversion of xvgr generated PS
to EPS. I'll continue to work on this - the main problem is that xvgr does
not correctly compute the bounding box. If you are using Latex, I believe
bbfig will give the correct bounding box. This (the BoundingBox line) should 
be placed toward the beginning of the file rather than at the end of the
PostScript output from xvgr.

Like:

%!PS-Adobe-2.0 EPSF-1.2
%%Creator: XVGR v2.07
%%Title: XVGR Graphics
%%BoundingBox: 0 0 611 791 

And remove the bounding box comment at the end of the file.


For Interleaf:

From Bruce Barnett (barnett@alydar.crd.ge.com) on including xvgr generated 
files into Interleaf:

2) I found a way to include XVGR files into Interleaf. This is what I did.
	1) I saved the file in PostScript LansScape mode.
	2) Ran the file thru the following sed filter:

#!/bin/sh
# convert the XVGR postscript file into encapsulated postscript
# usage
#	xvgr2ps <p.out >p.eps

sed '
 s/^%! PostScript/%!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0/
 s/^showpage//
 s/%%BoundingBox: [0-9]* [0-9]* [0-9]* [0-9]*/%%BoundingBox: 1 1 700 900/
' 
----------------------------------
This changes the format to meet the encapsulated postscript format.
The commenting out of showpage should not be necessary, but I did it anyway.

I also had to edit the bounding box, as it seemed your numbers were off.
(I typically got numbers like %%BoundingBox: 128 126 486 634)
and this truncated the document when I printed it.

To include the PS file into interleaf, move the new file into your ~/desktop
directory, rescan (to update the icons), and then select and cut/copy
the document. Then you open your document, and paste it in.

It will be displayed as a gray rectangle, but you can resize it.

        I have sucessfully used the following csh script to fix the
xvgr postscript to be an EPSF file for inclusion in a tex document.

--------------- Cut Here for xvgr2eps -------------------
#! /usr/bin/csh -f
# convert the XVGR postscript file into encapsulated postscript
# usage
#       xvgr2eps xvgr-file.ps
mv $1 tmp$$.ps
unset noclobber
echo '%\!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0' >! $1:r.ps
echo '%%BoundingBox: 40 50 550 700' >> $1:r.ps
sed '/%%Creator/,/%%Trailer/\!d' tmp$$.ps >> $1:r.ps
/bin/rm -f tmp$$.ps
