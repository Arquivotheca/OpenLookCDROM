:FileButton
File 

Provides these functions:

 - Copy a file or directory from the remote host 
   to the local host
 - Copy a file or directory from the local host 
   to the remote host
 - Uncompress selected local files
 - Extract selected local tar files
 - Compress selected local files
 - Create a tar file of the selected items
 - Show information about ftptool
#
:FileCopyRemote
Copy from Remote to local

Copy the selected files from the remote host to 
the local host. Normal files or directories may
be copied.
 
You will not be able to select this if you are
not connected to a remote host or you have no
remote files or directories selected.
#
:FileCopyLocal
Copy from Local to Remote

Copy the selected files from the local host to 
the remote host. Normal files or directories may
be copied.
 
You will not be able to select this if you are
not connected to a remote host or you have no
local files or directories selected.
#
:FileDeleteRemote
Delete Remote File

Delete the selected remote files(s). Directories
will be recursively deleted. If you have set
the "Confirm Deletes" property, then you will
be asked whether you want to really delete each
file (this _may_ be quite annoying for
directories!). There is _no way_ to retrieve
deleted files.
#
:FileDeleteLocal
Delete Local File

Delete the selected local files(s). Directories
will be recursively deleted. If you have set
the "Confirm Deletes" property, then you will
be asked whether you want to really delete each
file (this _may_ be quite annoying for
directories!). There is _no way_ to retrieve
deleted files.
#
:FileCompress
Compress File

Compress the selected local files. Only normal
files may be compressed. The compressed files
will have a '.Z' extension.

You will not be able to select this if you have
no local files selected.
#
:FileUncompress
Uncompress File

Uncompress the selected local files. Only normal
files may be uncompressed. Compressed files must
end in '.Z'.

You will not be able to select this if you have
no local files selected.
#
:FileCreateTar
Create Tar File

Place the selected local files and directories in
a tar file. You will be asked for the name of
the tarfile. Use a name ending in '.tar', or 
Ftptool will not understand it is a tar file
if you try to View it later. The original files
will not be removed.
 
You will not be able to select this if you have
no local files or directories selected.
#
:FileExtractTar
Extract Tar File

If the files selected are compressed, they will
first be uncompressed. If they end in '.tar', 
they are assumed to be tar archives. A tar file
viewer is started. The default viewer allows
listing of the contents of the tar file, and
extracting the contents into a specified directory.

You will not be able to select this if you have
no local files selected.
#
:FileAbout
About Ftptool

This displays a window with information about 
ftptool.
#
:ViewButton
View

Provides these functions:

 - View a remote file

 - View the host information pop-up
#
:ViewRemote
Remote File

Copies the remote file(s) to /var/tmp on the 
local machine. It then tries to determine the
file type, and start the appropriate viewer.
The file types understood are:

 - compressed - this is determined from the
   file itself, although it must have a '.Z'
   extension for uncompress to work.
 - postscript - if the first two characters
   are '%!', then it assumed to be a postscript
   file, and pageview is used to view it.
 - tar - this is determined from the extension,
   which must be '.tar' (not required by tar,
   currently just an easy way for ftptool to
   determine the type). As ftptool gets more
   intelligent, more archives may be understood.
   The default viewer is ftptool for archives,
   but may be changed by a property.
 - other - anything else. The default viewer
   for these files is textedit, but may be
   changed by a property.

You will not be able to select this if you
are not currently connected, or do not have
any remote files selected.
#
:ViewLocal
Local File

The current files are examined to determine the
file type, then the appropriate viewer is 
started.  The file types understood are:

 - compressed - this is determined from the
   file itself, although it must have a '.Z'
   extension for uncompress to work.
 - postscript - if the first two characters
   are '%!', then it assumed to be a postscript
   file, and pageview is used to view it.
 - tar - this is determined from the extension,
   which must be '.tar' (not required by tar,
   currently just an easy way for ftptool to
   determine the type). As ftptool gets more
   intelligent, more archives may be understood.
   The default viewer is ftptool for archives,
   but may be changed by a property.
 - other - anything else. The default viewer
   for these files is textedit, but may be

The current files are examined to determine the
file type, then the appropriate viewer is 
started.  The file types understood are:

 - compressed - this is determined from the
   file itself, although it must have a '.Z'
   extension for uncompress to work.
 - postscript - if the first two characters
   are '%!', then it assumed to be a postscript

is currently selected.
#
:SessionLog
Session Log

Any output from FTP will be logged here. 
#
:PropertyPassword
Default Password

The default password you want ftptool to use when
first starting, and when the password field is
blank. It defaults to user@machine[.domain].
#
:PropertyOptions
FTP Options

Several options for FTP:
 - Log session - enables Session Log window
 - Keep connection alive - by default, after
   15 minutes of inactivity, the ftp 
   connection will be broken. To prevent this,
   this option will cause a NOOP command to
   be sent every 10 minutes of inactivity.

The default is to not log and 
to not keep the connection alive.
#
:PropertyHidden
Hidden Files

Hidden files (files beginning with a '.') can
be ignored or shown.

The default is to hide hidden files.
#
:PropertyConfirm
Confirm 

If Confirm Deletions is TRUE, ftptool asks for 
confirmation when deleting a file.

If Confirm OverWrites is TRUE, and an attempt
to receive a file would overwrite an existing
one, ftptool will ask if you really want to
continue, or abort the transfer.
#
:PropertySortChoice
Sort remote files by

You can sort by filename, modification date,
size, or type.

The default is to sort by name.
#
:PropertyLocalSortChoice
Sort local files by

You can sort by filename, modification date,
size, or type.

The default is to sort by name.
#
:PropertySortDirection
Sort order

The sort can be in forward or reverse order.
Specifically, the directions are:
 - alphabetical or reverse alphabetical	
 - least or most recently modified
 - smallest to largest.

The default is to sort in alphabetical order.
#
:PropertyViewer
Default file viewer

The command line to use to view files of
unkonwn types (such as text). This should be
an X program, and will be broken up into
appropriate arguments. '%f' represents the
program name; if not specified, it will 
recieve the filename as the final argument.

The default is 'textedit %f'.
#
:PropertyKnownExtensions
Known extensions

This is a list of extensions known to 
ftptool. Selecting one fills in the fields 
below. The Add, Delete, and Change buttons 
work based on the Extension field below.
#
:PropertyAddExtension
Add

Add the extension information into the list. 
This is based on the Extension name, in the 
field below the list.  If the extension 
already exists, you will be asked if you
really want to change it.
#
:PropertyDeleteExtension
Delete

Delete the extension information from the 
list. This is based on the Extension name, 
in the field below the list.
#
:PropertyChangeExtension
Change

Add the extension information into the 
list. This is based on the Extension name, 
in the field below the list.  If the extension 
already exists, you will be asked if you
really want to change it.

This is really the same as Add, but it will 
automatically replace an existing extension.
#
:PropertyExtension
Extension

The extension ftptool will look for when 
examining file types. This is the key used 
to index the entry.
#
:PropertyMagic
Contents begin with

This specifies the first N characters of the 
file. When Viewing a file, ftptool determines 
the type both by the extension and the contents
of this field. If there is a discrepency 
ftptool uses the program associated with
the Contents (this field overrides the 
extension). If you leave this field alone (as 
an empty line), it is not used.
#
:PropertyProgram
Program to run

The program to invoke to view the file. This 
is a command line, which will be broken up 
into arguments. '%f' will be replaced by the
file name to view; if not specified, the file 
name will be passed as the last argument.
#
:PropertySortApply
Apply

Apply changes. You will be given the option to
apply the changes permanently. If you choose
to do so, your .Xdefaults file will be modified.
A backup will be saved in .Xdefaults.bak.
#
:PropertySortReset
Reset

Lose all changes made since the last apply.
#
:HostListWindow
Personal FTP Host List

This is your personal FTP host list. It allows
you to save your most recently used sites and
logins in a menu, as the .netrc ftp uses does.
This menu is saved in .ftptoolrc (which is
constructed from .netrc if it doesn't exist)
in ASCII, so you can edit it by hand.

Be careful when saving password information, as
it is stored in non-encrypted form! This is
as ftp does. Ftptool will create the .ftptool
rc with mode 600, but it is still a risk. You
might want to only save anonymous ftp passwords
here, and always type your password in when
you connect.
#
:AboutWindow
About Ftptool

Displays a message about ftptool. 

:FeedbackWindow
Send Feedback

Allows you to send mail to the developer
of ftptool. 
#
#
:FileProperty
Ftptool:File Properties

Properties of the remote or local file. This is
more than the list will show. It is only updated 
whenever a list element is selected, so it will
only show information about the most recently
selected item.

If you have no items selected, you will not be
able to bring up the appropriate property window.

File properties can not be changed from within
Ftptool.
#
:FilePropertyName

group name, or a group id if the name can not
be determined.

For non-unix remote hosts, this will show up
as "unknown".
#
:FilePropertyModtime

For non-unix remote hosts, this will show up
as "unknown".
#
:FilePropertySize

group of the file.

For non-unix remote hosts, the check boxes
will be blank.
#
:FilePropertyOtherPerms

Add the selected local file(s) to the batch 
send list.
#
:PropertyCacheSize
Directory Cache Size

Determines how many directory listings ftptool 
will remember. This is managed as an LRU cache,
so everytime you CD into a directory ftptool
first looks in the cache. If it finds it, then
instead of actually reading the directory it
just displays the list in the cache. This can
speed up directory listings on slow links.
The larger you make the cache, the more memory
you will use and (if you keep listing the same
directories) the less likely you'll have to
talk to the remote server. However, the larger
the cache, the less likely it is that you'll
see any changes being made on the cached
directories. To effectively not cache at all,
set this to 1.

There are two caches, one for local directories
and one for remote. This property controls
both (setting it to 2 actually means you'll
cache 4 directories: 2 local and 2 remote).
#
:PropertyCacheInf
Unlimit Cache Size

See Directory Cache Size for an explanation.
This option causes ftptool to cache _all_
directories. It could be quite a memory
waster.
#
:QuitButton
Quit

Quit ftptool.
#
:PropertyOpenLook
OPEN LOOK Mode

If set, indicates that you are using an OPEN
LOOK Window Manager. Currently if this is
_not_ set, ftptool and the tar viewer will 
have a Quit button, and most of the pop-ups
will have Dismiss buttons.

Also, if you try to View a window that is 
already displayed it will be hidden. 
#
:PropertySortGrouping
Group files by type

If set, files are grouped by their
types (directories first, then regular
files, ...) in addition to being sorted
normally.
#
:PropertyLocalSortGrouping

If set, files are grouped by their
types (directories first, then regular
files, ...) in addition to being sorted
normally.
#
:TarQuitButton
Quit

Quit the tar viewer.
#
:DismissButton
Dismiss

Dismiss the pop-up. 
#
:HostSaveHostList
Save Host List

Saves your personal host list in .ftptoolrc. It 
will first attempt to save it in your home 
directory ($HOME), or the current directory if 
that fails. If you have made changes to the list, 
(needed) will appear in the option.
#
:HostLoadHostList
Load Host List

Loads your personal host list from .ftptoolrc, 
first looking in your home directory ($HOME) and 
then looking in the current directory if needed.  
This can be used if you want to discard changes 
you've made since the last save, or if you modify 
the .ftptoolrc file outside of ftptool (otherwise 
ftptool won't know about it).
#
:HostAppendNetRC
Append .netrc

Looks for a .netrc in your home directory, then 
the current directory if needed. Loads 'machine' 
entries into your host list, using a name of 
'machinename loginname'. You can then change the 
name to something more meaningful. Valid entries 
must contain at least a 'machine' keyword and a 
'login' entry. 'macdef' is not recognized.
 
If you do not have a .ftptoolrc, then ftptool 
will look for a .netrc file at startup.
  
You will not be able to select this if you do 
not have a .netrc.
#
:HostWindow
Host Information

This is the host window. It allows you to
connect to ftp servers.

It is also your personal FTP host list. It 
allows you to save your most recently used sites 
and logins in a menu, as the .netrc ftp uses does.
This menu is saved in .ftptoolrc (which is
constructed from .netrc if it doesn't exist)
in ASCII, so you can edit it by hand.

Be careful when saving password information, as
it is stored in a weakly-encrypted form! 
Ftptool will also create the .ftptoolrc with mode 
600, but it is still a risk. 
#
:HostsButton
Hosts

This is the menu containing your host aliases.
Selecting one will cause the information about
the host to be loaded. If the auto-connect
option is set, then it will also attempt to
connect to that host.
#
:HostListAdd
Add

Add the information listed in the host list
window to your list of hosts. Addition is
based on the value given in the Host Alias
field. If you try to add an alias that
already exists, you will be asked if you really
want to replace the existing entry.
#
:HostListChange
Change

Add the information listed in the host list
window to your list of hosts. Addition is
based on the value given in the Host Alias
field. If you try to add an alias that
already exists, you will not be asked if you 
really want to replace the existing entry.
#
:HostListDelete
Delete

Delete the entry in the host list that matches
the value in the Host Alias field. Note that
selecting an entry is not required to delete
it, although selecting it will fill in the
host information. A delete operation will
then delete that entry.

:HostWindowProxy
Proxy host

Give the hostname of the proxy host to use. This 
should be the full name (including domain) to 
make sure the right host is connected to. 
This defaults to sun-barr.EBay.

Internet addresses can be used if you wish.
#
:HostWindowHostname
Remote host

The hostname of the host to connect to. This 
should be the full name (including domain) to 
make sure the right host is connected to. 
This defaults to yavin.EBay.

Internet addresses can be used if you wish.
#
:HostWindowLogin
Login

The login name to use when connecting to the
remote host. This defaults to 'anonymous'.
#
:HostWindowPassword
Password

The password to give when logging in to the remote
host. It will be displayed as '*'s instead of
the actual characters. Pressing return in this 
field will automatically attempt to connect.

If this field is empty, the default password
will be used.
#
:HostWindowAccount
Account

The account to give when logging in to the remote
host. This is not usually needed. Pressing return 
in this field will automatically attempt to connect.

If this field is empty, an account will not be
passed.
#
:HostWindowDirectory
Remote Directory

The remote directory to change to upon connecting.
#
:HostWindowLocalDirectory
Local Directory

The local directory to change to upon connecting.
#
:HostWindowDirTemplate
DIR Template

The template is a series of keywords 
separated by whitespace or characters
that must match (so if there are dashes in 
the date, you theoretically give 
MONTH-DAY-YEAR). See the manual page for 
more information. The keywords are:
.in +4 
PERMS   - Normal UNIX permissions 
		  (drwxrwxrwx) 
LINKS   - Link count. Currently matched, 
		  but discarded
USER    - User name/number 
GROUP   - Group name/number
SIZE    - File size 
MONTH   - Month (Dec, Jan, ...) 
DAY     - Day of week (number) 
TIME    - Hour:minute (09:49) or 
		  year (1991) 
NAME    - Filename
SKIP    - Discard characters until the 
		  next whitespace.

NONUNIX is a special case. Its appearence
anywhere in the string sets non-UNIX mode
(use 'ls' and not 'dir', assume everything
is a file, but you can still try to cd
by double-clicking)

LOWERNAMES is also a special case. It
causes all filenames read from the remote
machine to be converted to lowercase.
#
:HostWindowConnectButton
Connect

Add the current target and file list to
the batch list. Many defaults, such as 
remote and local directories, are taken
from the host information window.
#

Add the current target and file list to
the batch list. Same as Add, but does
not ask for confirmation if the entry 
exists. 
#

This allows you to determine what the
DIR template should be.
#
:FileLS

Do a LS command in the session log.
#
:TotalGauge
Total Gauge

The gauge shows how far the total
transfer has progressed, from 0 to 
100% complete.
#
:FileGauge
File Gauge

The gauge shows how far the transfer
has progressed on the current file, 
from 0 to 100% complete.
#
:StatusWindow
Status Window

This window shows what you are
transferring, how large it is, and how
far along the transfer is.
#
:PropertiesSaveLayout
Save Layout

Save the layout of ftptool. This includes
the sizes and locations of most of the
windows, along with whether the main 
windows are visible.
#
:PropertyIgnoreCase
Ignore Case

When generating the host menu, ignore
the case of the alias. Also, ignore
case in the remote and local lists.
#
:PropertyAuto
Connect

If set, when you select a host from the
menu ftptool will try to connect to that
host. If not, selecting a host will just
fill in the host information window.

Show Status

Always show the transfer status window
when doing a transfer. If not set, don't
display it. You can still bring it
up from the View menu.

Try Sun Proxy FTP 

If TRUE, ftptool will automatically try to use
Sun's proxy FTP (from Sun Consulting) if it
cannot resolve the hostname (the host is 
unkown) or it receives a 'Network unreachable'
error when trying to connect. This is primarily 
used by Sun folks trying to get out to the Internet.
#
:PlusButton
Plus

When pressed, displays the Advanced portion
of the host window.
#
:MinusButton
Minus

When pressed, hides the Advanced portion
of the host window.
#
:RemoteOSType
Remote host runs

Indicates which type of operating system the
remote system runs, so ftptool knows how to
interpret the output of directory listings.
Most UNIX systems should use UNIX, and VMS
systems should use VMS. If ftptool is confused
by the directory listing, it will just list
the filenames (and you will lose all type
and permission information). If this occurs,
you can choose Other, and specify the pattern
that ftptool should look for.
#
:PropertyUnique
Generate Unique 

Local Filenames

This causes ftptool to generate unique
local filenames of the form N.filename, where 
N is a number, if filename already exists  
on  the  local  machine.

Remote Filenames

This causes ftptool to use the Store Unique 
FTP command when sending files, to make 
the remote server generate unique filenames 
if filename exists.
#
:HostList
Host List

A scrolling list of entries in the host
database. It's size can be adjusted by
a property in the Properties window, but
is determined at startup.
#
:PropertyDecompressor
Default file decompressor

The compression program to use when compressing
a file.  This is a command line which will be
broken up into arguments. '%f' will be replaced
by the file name that is being compressed.
If not specified, the file name will be passed
as the last argument.
#
:PropertyType
Program is a

Either a 'file viewer' or a 'decompressor'.
The 'decompressor' is used when you try
to decompress a file from the File menu.
It is also automatically used if you try
to view a compressed file (it will first
be decompressed before the viewer program
is launched).
#
:ScheduleRepeat
Repeat

If checked, do not remove this batch transfer
from the list. Instead, repeat it again in
the number of minutes given in that field.
#
:ScheduleRepeatMinutes
Repeat minutes

The number of minutes before the
transfer is performed again.
