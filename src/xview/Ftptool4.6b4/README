The source for ftptool is, as far as I'm concerned freely distributable as 
long as I recieve credit for it (my bosses agree, though Sun hasn't spoken).

You should be able to compile and run it on 4.1.X, OW2 or better. You
might want to use xview3, which is available with the OW3 CD or from
export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib/xview3. For a sun3, you may also need
the unofficial patch /contrib/xview3/Fixes/xview3.0_unofficial_patch
(unless Patch-02 fixed those problems).  Other operating
systems (besides SunOS 5.0) have not been tested by me, though I believe 
it works under Ultrix and 386SVR4.

You can either use the supplied Makefile.sun, or use the Imakefile (which
seems to work, but I'm not an Imakefile expert so I'm not sure. I _have_ been
using a Makefile generated from this one though). You should be able to
compile a version for SunOS 5.x by modifying Makefile.sun.
I now use 5.x as my development platform.

Also, make sure config.h is set up appropriately for your system.
