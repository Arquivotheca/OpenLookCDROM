Have a placeholder for the users name and password, so that
creating a default ftptoolrc can be easier?

Allow macros per-site, along with init-macros?
This could subsume the auto-cd stuff.

- Reset the cursor to the hostname field in the connection popup
  after the user disconnects.  Usually I want to connect to
  another host; I shouldn't have to reposition the cursor with
  a mouse click to do that.  Hitting shift-return doesn't seem
  to back the cursor up to the previous field, either.

The "About ftptool" window is (intentionally, I guess) read-only.
That is, it is not possible to set the caret in this window, but
apparently it is still possible to select a part of the text, and
afterwards "dragging and inserting" the text somewhere else in 
the window. Just a bit disturbing on the otherwise polished
interface.

Keep track of all directories transferred, to prevent handling
links like /usr/pub -> /. Or just create links when they are
found.

- when using the ' view remote file' option repeatedly on the same filename ,but on a file in a different directory, the first file is shown.

- an option to make the batch mode run in background (without the 
  X server).
- multiconnections on multiservers.
- keep the use of ftptool when batch mode is on.

auto-popup the transfer status window if you View something.

Mark files already transferred?

Add FONT_SIZE to panel font creation?

For each cached directory, save last selected object so it can be
restored?

Add an archie interface.

Remember where you were on the remote server when you disconnect,
and put you back there on reconnect? An option + changing the auto-remote
cd field.

Run simple ftp commands on connect to a host?

Provide an interactive window?

Do proxy ftp? Have a host/login/password global default, or per-host?

After summing the transfer size, make sure there's enough space
locally?

If a local file exists, only overwrite it if it is more recent
than the remote one (size and date check)? This would have to
be based on a property.

Have an option on each list popup to just sum the transfer size.

Menu button to show previous directories, like xv?

Be able to do selections by pattern. This would be a good general
function that could work on directory lists _and_ the host list.

Allow batch transfers to be specified as 'daily', 'weekly', and 'monthly'.
Also, remember state betwen ftptool sessions. 

An abort for connections. A timeout from a down or slow host can take a while.

The ability to re-order the current directory without changing the entire
sessionor defaults. In other words, it would be nice to get the Directory
Lists properties for the current directory only. Maybe through the Popup menu...

It would be nice to be able to merge the .ftptoolrc back into the .netrc I
think it would probably be a pain to do this properly (checking for existing
entries etc

I would like to be able to double click on a remote text file,
get it up in my favorite local editor, save it  and quit from the editor, and have the updated copy of the text file auto-magically
update in the original location.
