      ROLO - Manage notes like a Rolodex

        Each note in your Rolo file is meant to
simulate a 3x5 card upon which you may scribble
anything you like.  You can have any number of
cards in your rolodex, Rolo will keep track of
them for you.  You may browse around through
them, create new ones, throw old ones away,
search for strings in them, etc.

        The buttons in the top part of the Rolo
window provide the main controls with which
you manipulate your cards.  Every button on
the control panel has a menu attached which
can be pulled up by pressing the right mouse
button over that item.
Clicking the button directly is equivalent to
selecting the default item from the button menus.

DRAG AND DROP IS SUPPORTED
To load a file:
        Drag a rolofile from the file manager and
   drop it into the control panel or inside the
   load-file pop window.
To load a card:
        Drag a mailfile or a file and drop it inside the
    rolocard (textsw) region.

Warning: There is no error checking on the file format
or content (drag in garbage at your own risk).

        This button deletes cards from your

cards and may be retrieved any time before Rolo

card. 
        You can rearrange the order of the cards

a new position, then undeleting it. Note that
blanks cards containing only white space are
not saved on the undeleted stack, they are
thrown away.

:file
FILE MENU

Load: From current file
	Loads your rolodex cards from that file
as-of the last time they were saved.(the file name
listed in the title bar). You can also reload
the cards from that file as-of the last time
they were saved.

Load: From named file
            Pops a window, and prompts for a file
    name. The default file is shown in the text field.
    It then loads your rolodex cards from that file.

Save: To current file
            Saves your rolodex cards to that file
    that the cards were loaded from.(default: ~/.rolo)

Save: To  named file
            Pops a window, and prompts for a file
    name. The default file is shown in the text field.
    It then saves your rolodex cards to that file.

        Saving to or loading from a file 
causes that new file to become the default
for the regular load and save operations.  You will
be warned about unsaved modifications to your cards,
overwriting existing files, etc.


:find
FIND BUTTON
   This button searches for a regular expression
in your cards.  This can be used to find any
text pattern which appears anywhere in any of
your cards.  The pattern to search for may be
entered in the text item to the right of the
Find button.  If, at the time the Find
button is clicked, with no text in to text item,
the active selection will be used instead.
      Pressing the return key in the search
pattern item is equivalent to clicking the Find
button but ignoring the selection.
      Due to the way the library search
routines work, all the text of a given card
is treated as one logical line.  The
main effect of this is that the '^' and '$'
operations won't match individual lines within
a card, only the text of the card as a whole.
Note: \"Regular expressions\" are the kind used
by egrep(1), which are not the same as the
shell meta-characters.

:slider
SLIDER
       The slider item on the control panel may
be used to select any card directly.  Simply
drag the bar back and forth until the number
of the card you wish to see is displayed to
the left of the slider, then release the
mouse button.
Clicking the mouse in  buttons on the ends of
the slider gets you to the first and the last
card.
