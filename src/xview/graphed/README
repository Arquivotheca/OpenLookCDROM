Software Announcement : GraphEd Version 2.1
===========================================

GraphEd is a powerful graph and graph grammar editor for SUN Workstations.
Basic features are

- flexible graph drawing
  - directed / undirected graphs, with labels
  - arbitrary node shapes and line styles
  - edges are polylines
  - colors
  - arbitrary fonts for labels
  - automatic label placements
  - automatic edge placements
- powerful user interface
  - fully mouse- and menudriven
  - easy to use
  - fast
  - online help
  - can generate output for PostScript and NEC P7 printers
  - flexible file format
- graph grammars
  - BNLC to 1-eNCE grammars
  - directed / undirected
  - interactive derivations
- many layout a lgorithms; probably the largest layout library
  - arbitrary graphs
  - trees
  - DAG's
  - planar graphs
  - Petri Nets
- interface for user-specific extensions written in C (Sgraph)

GraphEd can be (and already is) used for

- drawing graphs
- learning and studying graph grammars
- implementing graph algorithms
- implementing and studying layout algorithms
- algorithm animation
- implementing graphical front ends

GraphEd currently runs on SUN workstations under SunView. An OpenWindows /
XView version is under development. We are behind schedule, most becase of
manpower problems, but expect to have a mostly-converted version (probably
without fonts and colors and less efficient graphics) this spring.

And best, GraphEd is free for non-commercial use. Source and manuals are
available via anonymous ftp from

    forwiss.uni-passau.de (132.231.1.10) : /pub/local/graphed

Files : graphed2.1.tar.Z
        GraphEd1.35Manual.sit.hqx.Z
	Sgraph3.0Manual_beta.sit.hqx.Z

The Manuals need a Macintosh, MSWord 4.0  and at  least  StuffIt 1.5.1
(to decode BinHex and  unpack).  I  have  also included  the following
variants of the Sgraph Documentation :

	Sgraph3.0Manual_beta.sit.Z  (Macintosh Binary)
        Sgraph3.0Manual_beta.RTF.Z
        Sgraph3.0Manual_beta.TEXT.Z

Many Word processors can handle RTF; it might  be an option if  no Mac
is available. The TEXT version is plain text without pictures. Printed
versions   are available  from the  author.    The Sgraph manual is  a
preliminary   version  and   may need  some   cleanup,   but is usable
otherwise.


There is also a version (including manuals) on

	ftp.uu.net:/graphics/graphed2.1.tar.Z

Upgrades : For   those who do  already  have GraphEd  2.1b*, the   new
release is  mainly  a bug  fix.   Upgrade from  previous  versions  is
recommended - there are a lot of new features. Most features described
in the Sgraph 3.0 Manual need GraphEd 2.1.
