<P>
Here's the first couple of paragraphs from the manual, to give you a
teaser of what apeX is all about:
<P>
Welcome to apeX!  apeX is a free development tool intended to
help increase a developer's productivity.  In particular, apeX
tries to address the following problems:
<PRE>
	How do you help developers read and understand large programs?
	How do you make it easier for developers to write new code,
		reusing older  code as appropriate?  
	How do you document code so that the documentation does not 	
		clutter the code, yet is readily available when needed?
</PRE>
<P>
To address these problems, apeX is organized into two main
functional units, the Navigator and the Object-Linking Editor.
The Navigator allows users to graphically browse through the
call structure of a program, including both calls to and from a
particular function.  The Navigator is tightly integrated with
the editor, so that at any point the user can easily view the
code of a particular function (when available, of course!).
<P>
The Editor is a standard full-featured Openwindows texteditor,
augmented with Object-Linking capabilities.  Technically, this
means that a user can create, view, and execute links between
two arbitrary sections of text in two arbitrary files.  At the
simplest level, this allows users to attach more detailed
comments to source code.  Thus, source code can be extensively
documented without excess clutter.
<P>
Since link descriptions can be passed to a shell and executed,
users can attach virtually anything as documentation--audio
comments, technical papers, even movies animating the
algorithms used!  More importantly, these attachments are available
at click of a mouse button from the source code.
<P>
Two other tools are included within the apeX program itself: a
shell with an built-in version-control interface and a scratch
pad, for jotting to-do-lists and other notes.
<P>
This release of apeX is known to work on Sun SparcStations running Openwin3.0.
Sun binaries are included in the bin directory, so you will not have to compile
anything to use apeX.
<P>
If you wish to compile apeX, you will need to get and install the slingshot
package.  Depending on your system configuration, you
may need to edit the Makefile to include the proper X header files.
<P>
The apeX version control system interfaces to RCS, so you will need to either 
have RCS installed or edit the scripts apex_ci and apex_co to use your
native version control system.
<P>
The apeX manual can be found in the doc directory as apex_man.latex.  The 
dvi file is also included so that sites without LaTeX can simply print out
the manual using lpr -d.
<P>
The source to apeX contains examples of Object Links.  Simply load a *.apex
file in the ./src/apex directory.
<P>
If you have any comments, suggestions, bug reports, etc, please let me know!

<P>Note:  This distribution also includes apeX Animate, a utility program for 
displaying X bitmap movies.
