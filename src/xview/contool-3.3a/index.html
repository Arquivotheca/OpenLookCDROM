<H1>Contool, a fancy console program</H1>
<P>Well, the title tells it. Contool is like cmdtool -C or xterm -C,
but much more flexible. It has regular expression matching, and 
lets you have certain messages ignored, while others will ring the bell
or even cause contool's icon to pop open to the full window.

Like catcher, it was written by Chuck Musciano, at Harris Corporation.
And like catcher, it comes with a restrictive copyright that means that
we were not able to include contool at this time.
You can obtain a copy by FTP from many archive sites,
so use archie or your favorite Net Searching tool to find a copy.
