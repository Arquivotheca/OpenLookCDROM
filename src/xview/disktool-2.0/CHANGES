 08/29/94 Version 2.0
=====================

o Can now add filesystem on the fly
	On the Properties pop-up window, the Filesystem item is now an
	editable field where a new filesystem can be typed in and the
	threshold and units can be adjusted before pressing the "Add
	Filesystem" button.
o Can now remove filesystem on the fly
	A delete button has been added to the Properties pop-up window
	to remove the current selected filesystem from the disktool main
	gauge window.
o Allow action after x number of polls
	Previous to this release, disktool would only signal a critical
	condition once for each filesystem and would only reset if the
	filesystem re-gained available disk space and went above critical.
	Now through the cmdline option, "-r", or the properties pop-up
	window, a value can be specified as to how often a signal will be
	sent. A value of "0" is the default and specifies the old method
	of only one signal when the filesystem first goes critical. Any
	other positive integer value specifies the number of polls before
	the signal is repeated. This will happen indefinately until the
	filesystem rises above the critical condition.
o Force a filesystem poll with middle mouse button click
o Added deltas
	If "-d" cmdline option is specified, disktool will continually
	display a delta since the last poll. The color will reflect 
	whether there was a gain or a loss. By default, green for gain
	and red for loss.
o Added keyboard accelerators
	+,-	Respectively, increase & decrease the polling interval
		by 10 seconds with each keypress.
	=	Display polling interval in the left footer for 1 second
		before returning to the timestamp display.
	h,v	Respectively, change to horizontal or vertical layout.
	p	Force an immediate filesystem poll.
	q,x	Quit disktool.
o Added -cmd cmdline option
	Can now specify the command to be executed when a filesystem
	being monitored goes critical from the disktool command line.
o Added KB parsing of cmdline args
	Any threshold value containing a 'K' will be understood to be KB's,
	anything else will default to MB's.
o Now checks for more than MAX_GAUGES filesystems
	Now will not crash if more then MAX_GAUGES filesystems are specified.
o Now has a Min. width
	No longer truncates the timestamp in the footer if only one
	filesystem is specified with a short name (ie. /) in horizontal
	layout.
o Added -used cmdline option
	Reverses the function of the gauge displays to show disk space used
	instead of the default, disk space avail.

 08/12/94 Version 1.3c
======================

o Revised SOLARIS2 support

 05/25/94 Version 1.3b
======================

o Added display of Thresholds.
o Added Auto-calc of spacing if not specified on cmdline.
o Added ability to adjust hort/vert mode, spacing and max gauges
  per row/column on the fly.
o kbyte_item's are now (pseudo-)centerd below gauge in vertical layout.
o Increased Max polling time from 600 to 3600 seconds.

 05/18/94 Version 1.3a
======================

o Updated for Solaris 2.x and HP-UX support.
	This version (1.3a) is being supplied solely for the support of
	the Solaris 2.3 (Hopefully 2.1 & 2.2 as well, but I can not test
	that) Operating system. Also, with the help of some feedback, this
	version should also compile under HP-UX (Don't know the Rev. of
	the OS). I am currently attempting to build and install the XView3.2
	libraries on an HP 9000/735 OS Rev. A.09.01 so as to facilitate
	my own testing. Until that happens, I would appreciate any feedback
	on the changes I made to the Makefile and common.h files to
	support the HP-UX compile of disktool.

 05/10/94 Version 1.3
=====================

o Removed "-range" option. Now determines range from filesystem size.
o Added "-spacing" cmdline option for spacing of gauges.
o Added "-lineup" cmdline option for the # of gauges before starting a
  new row or column.
o Expanded "." filesystem to the actual pathname.
o Re-worked the "-threshold" cmdline option to be more flexible.
o Added ability to save cmdline options with a "SAVE_WORKSPACE".

 04/15/94 Version 1.2
=====================

o Added check for existance of specified disks.


 11/04/93 Version 1.1
=====================

o Changed the "OK" color to GREEN (was WHITE)
o Added a timestamp for the last time disks were polled to FRAME_LEFT_FOOTER.
o Changed the ICONs to display the hostname of the machine running disktool.

 07/07/93 Version 1.0
=====================

o Initial coding.
