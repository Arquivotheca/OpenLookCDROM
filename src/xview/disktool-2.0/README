README:                                             08/29/94

This has proved to be quite an experience for me with all the feedback
I have received from all over the world! Keep it up! Disktool has 
evolved from a simple program for my own use, to a very important tool
for many sysadmins out there on the InfoBan. I have been driven by user
requests and about 75% of this release is due to them.

Notes
=====

Read the CHANGES file for a brief description of the latest changes

The MIN and MAX polling intervals can be adjusted by changing the values
of MIN_POLL_INT and MAX_POLL_INT, respectively, in common.h

The "OK" and "Critical" colors can be adjusted by changing the value of 
OKCOLOR and CRITCOL, respectively, in common.h

Autocalc of spacing takes place if the spacing value is below 50(pixels).
This can be adjusted by changing the value of MINSPACING in common.h

Description
===========
`disktool' is an XView program to monitor up to 64 filesystems
simultaneously and alert you when a particular filesystem is low on
space. disktool is set-up to "un-iconify" when a filesystem it is
monitoring has reached its' user-definable "critical threshold". A
unix command can also be initiated when this threshold is reached.
The command and un-iconifying can be repeated every so many polls,
configurable from the cmdline or from the Properties pop-up.
The properties pop-up is obtained by selecting any gauge with the
right mouse button. The middle mouse button has also been mapped to 
force a filesystem poll to update the displayed data.

`disktool' is a good sysadmin tool for monitoring diskfull situations
to avoid datafile corruption.

This program is Copyright(c)1993,1994 Shaun Finn sfinn@astro.ge.com
but please feel free to e-mail me any suggestions for improvements
or bugs.

Compilation
===========
A makefile has been supplied that works under SunOS 4.1.3, Solaris 2.x,
and HP-UX(I hope) using the XView3.x libraries. There are some configurable
options, well marked, at the top of the Makefile for OS configuration.
A copy has also been supplied (Makefile.orig) in case you modify the
original and you haven't got a clue where you started (I've done this).

Installation
============
Move `disktool' to where you normally keep your binaries and move
disktool.man to where you normally keep your man pages.
