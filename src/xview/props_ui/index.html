<P>The following appeared in alt.toolkits.xview.
It puts up part of the GUI of the standard Properties program,
showing just how the categorized window stuff works.
There are absolutely no actions associated with it.
And, when you click on <I>Apply</I>, the window disappears but the
program keeps running. But it does show the Categorized Properties Window
in isolation, so it's worth keeping.

   You can also pick up a copy of Devguide 3.0.  It includes support
for layered panes.  With that support and the new connections you can
whip up the UI to a categorized property sheet in under 5 minutes.  I
whipped up a simple mockup of the desktop properties sheet and included
it below.
