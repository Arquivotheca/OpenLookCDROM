*** For Version 5.0 ********************************************************

  * Category creation and editing is now done through its own dialog
    window.  No more "sharing" functionality with item creation.  This
    changed both the category and item dialog boxes.  The ability to load
    the contents of a category from a file is given.

  * Categories are now hierarchical.  This effects the "listing"
    function; in addition to "list all", we now have "list tree" and
    "list category". The default setting for the button from its menu
    also has to change depending on the current setting.

  * Since categories are hierarchical, listing facilities are now
    expanded.  One can list all categories, one category, the "category 
    tree" at a certain point, or the parent category.  The "default
    menu selection" changes between "list all" and "list category" as
    user selects options.  The "List All" button changes to reflect the
    "default" action when button is pressed.

  * Because categories and listing have been expanded, printing is now
    expanded to include "Tree" additions, both to individual categories 
    and to the "List Tree" option.

  * Added file handling capability -- load, merge, save, and "save
    category" (saving of just a single category).  Used the GUIDE 
    "file chooser" for this; source included.  Thanks to Mike Perlman for
    the ideas here!

  * The program has "groupware" behaviour.  Routines are now interposed at
    certain key operations (e.g., window openings and closings) to make
    sure the database is properly updated with changes made by someone
    else. This will make using the whole system in a multiuser environment
    much more convenient.

  * Added "print to file" functionality to the print window.  Also, added
    new properties to control defaults wrt printing to files.

  * If specified on the property sheet, todo items are retained on the
    day they were checked off after propagation.
  
  * Attached copy/cut/paste functionality to the Copy/Cut/Paste keyboard
    function keys.

  * Interposed a routine to catch window openings and closings to make
    sure the database is properly read and written. This will make using
    "tdl" and using the whole system in a "groupware" environment much
    more convenient.

  * Adapted "tdl" to match the new functionality of its windowed
    sidekick.  It now also reads the .xvtdlrc file for defaults (thanks 
    to Joachim Holzfuss <hofu@nlp.physik.th-darmstadt.de> for this).

  * "Tdl" has a new "-categories" option to list the categories.

  * NEW ICON!!!  Thanks to Alexander Dupuy <dupuy@smatr.com> for the
    funky design.

  * BIG FIX: Finally fixed the program to accept double -- and single --
    quotes in item entries.  And in category names, for that matter.

  * Added priority changing (+/-) to the item edit menu.  The up-arrow
    and down-arrow keys also work here.

  * Removed a listing order "bias": when increasing priority, program
    checks listing order and adds or subtracts priority properly.

  * Changes to Makefile and IMakefile: YACC and LEX definitions are added
    to accomodate bison and flex; a bug in Imakefile with help files is
    fixed; BIN becomes BINDIR in Makefile.

  * Small change: 'char t' is changed to 'int t' to accomodate some
    versions of Un*x.

  * Small change II: Attempted to accomodate folks who place commas in 
    their GECOS fields.

  * LOTS of bug fixes.

*** For Version 4.0 ********************************************************

  * Added a deadline mechanism.  When propagating, XVTDL will take
    several actions when an item is past deadline (or, in one case, ON
    deadline). 

  * Reworked the recurrence editor: the way recurrences are specified is
    now much more flexible.

  * Changed the mouse functionality to be more "OpenLook-like": now, 
    checking on/off occurs with a mouse double click and edit functions
    work on a selected item.  This is cleaner and also fixes a problem
    where one could never cancel an edit mode if she changed her mind 
    after selecting a function from the edit menu.

  * The above necessitated a change to category editing.  Now modifying
    or deleting categories can only be done to the CURRENT category.

  * Altered the "look and feel" of the property specification sheet -- to
    be more like other Open Look tools (multiple "sheets", selectable 
    by a choice item).

  * Finally implemented the ordering of priority items -- specified by 
    property sheet -- on both display and printed output.

  * The priority specification on the entry editor and the property sheet
    is now a slider.  This makes for better error correction and removes
    the "bias" towards "up" being higher priority. Thanks to Alexander
    Dupuy <dupuy@cs.columbia.edu> for the suggestion.

  * Added a priority indicator for both forms of printouts.

  * Augmented the logging information to include category, priority, and
    date entered into XVTDL

  * Added a property sheet for default deadline settings.

  * Added a "default priority" property for item creation.

  * Changed the semantics of the "Cancel" button for user specified log
    entries.  Now, that button does not even enter the log entry into the
    log if the button is pressed.

  * The program now automatically adds the help path to the HELPPATH env
    variable.

  * When the number of weeks == 0 in recurrence editor, this is taken as 
    meaning "forever".

  * Added a "real" Imakefile.  Thanks to Rainer Klute 
    (klute@tommy.informatik.uni-dortmund.de) for his extensive contribution
    here.

  * BUG FIXES:
     + Fixed a bug pertaining to multipage output.  Version 4.0 paginates
       both normal and PostScript output properly.
     + Fixed the possibility of entering a priority < 1 or > 9 by hand.
     + Hitting "create" after starting an edit mode (between selecting
       action and choosing item) will cancel edit.
     + Fixed MANY bugs with propagation -- especially with propagating
       recurring items.
     + Rewriting the database file now retains the file mode of the 
       "old" database file being rewritten.
     + Fixed an edit bug: cutting a pasted item actually cut the item it 
       was copied from!
     + Fixed a cutting bug when cutting the last category would crash 
       the program.
     + Fixed a bug that caused faulty listings when using "List All" with
       categories with recurring items.
     + Entries with unbalanced parentheses confused the PostScript output.
       This is now fixed.
     + Fixed the bug where deleting any category displayed the correct
       new, but the wrong list name.
     + Printing now correctly substitutes "&" in gecos entry with login 
       name for title.

*** For Version 3.1 ********************************************************

  * Added interactive help.

  * Support for PRINTER environment variable: if the "Printer" X resource
    is empty, XVTDL will use the PRINTER environment variable to fill the
    default printer in the print window.

  * Added support for ISO 8859.1 characters in display, database storage,
    and PostScript output.  Thanks go to Mario Dorion of Sun 
    <Mario.Dorion@Canada.Sun.COM> for the PostScript changes to prolog1.ps.
    And to GNU flex for giving 8-bit character reading.

  * BUG FIXES: 
     + Fixed a bug in cancelling a log edit: the program would crash upon
       a "forgotten" file name.
     + "# of weeks" in the recurrence editor now starts @ 1.
     + Got rid of "list flashing" -- thanks go to Mario Dorion of Sun
       <Mario.Dorion@Canada.Sun.COM>
     + Fixed a small bug in main.c that handled non-existent database
       files incorrectly.
     + Fixed a bug pertaining to a non-existent "HOME" var in main.c
       (with thanks to Nick Holloway <alfie@dcs.warwick.ac.uk>)
     + Fixed a bug pertaining to deletion of categories -- when the category
       cut was the category displayed, all categories were deleted!
     + Fixed a bug that allowed multiple categories with the same name to
       be created.
     + Fixed a call to strftime that crashed Sun3 and Sun 386i versions
       of XVTDL (with thanks to Stephen Favor <xcpslf@decsrv.oryx.com>)
     + Fixed some window size/pinning bugs for XView 2.0.

*** For Version 3.0 ********************************************************

  * Added a multi-level logging feature.  The user can log at check off
    time, at quit/propagation time, or not at all.  The user can choose
    just a a time stamp on the log or can edit the comment that will go
    into the log.

  * Implemented a facility to list all category items in one display
    and integrated this into the print facility.

  * Added a "Done" button -- ala mailtool -- that dumps the database 
    file and iconifies the tool.

  * Added a properties windows that configures all the configurable
    elements of the system -- and sets all the X resources.

  * Added several X resources, settable by the configuration/properties
    interface.

  * Implemented an interpose function to catch the window menu "Quit".

  * Implemented a backup to the database file before a new file is 
    written.

  * Printing now uses the "gecos" field instead of the "username" field
    in the password file.

  * Added an Imakefile.

  * BUG FIXES: 
     + Fixed the hardcoded temporary file name for printing todo lists
       (thanks to George Lindholm <lindholm@ucs.ubc.ca> for the code).
     + Fixed a bug in the PostScript where checked off items appeared a 
       half-line up from where they should be.
     + Correctly implemented pushpin properties (note this required a
       little shucking and jiving between the recurrence and entry windows)
     + Fixed several list-manipulation bugs which caused anomalies when
       cutting and pasting.
     + Fixed a mis-setting of timer in main program (thanks to Chuck
       Strickland <chucks@orl.mmc.com> for the fix)

*** For Version 2.3 ********************************************************

  * Fixed a bug in getting resources when the resources were not in 
    database.

*** For Version 2.2 ********************************************************

  * Eliminated the completion of creation/edit by pressing Return on
    the Text field in entry.  It didn't work correctly.

  * Fixed a bug in todo list management when cutting.

  * Implemented the ability to print all todo list categories from the
    print window at once.

  * Added resources: Xvtdl.Printer (string) to define the default printer
                     Xvtdl.PostScript (boolean) to define the default
                        print mode

  * Makefile is a little more helpful in installation.

  * Implemented the editing of category names.

  * Implemented the deletion of list categories (and their items).

*** For Version 2.1 ********************************************************

  * Changed the order of "-lxview" and "-lolgx" in the Makefile
    to accomodate public domain versions of XView

  * Fixed a bug where entries over 50 characters long displayed junk.

  * For neatness sake, all bitmaps (*.pr) were placed in the "bitmaps"
    subdirectory.

  * Now the cursor changes for edits over the list subwindow as well as 
    other parts of the application.

  * Cleaned up the code to get rid of compilation warnings.

  * Fixed the README file to eliminate references to "prolog3.ps", since
    it is not used.

  * Resizing the window now resizes the todo list as well.
