*** This is version 5.0 of XVTDL, an XView To Do List Manager ***

XVTDL is a todo list manager.  XVTDL has the following features:

   * You can manage multiple todo lists; lists can have sublists.
   * Each todo list item is prioritized; each list can be displayed in 
     a combination of priority, chronological, and alphabetical 
     order.
   * List items, if you do not "check them off", will propagate from 
     one day to the next.  
   * List items can be recurring items, i.e., items that will 
     automatically pop up weekly, biweekly, monthly, etc.  These items
     will propagate like "normal" list items.
   * List items can have deadlines associated with them, with several
     types of actions that execute on or after a deadline.
   * You can set list items on any day, with easy calendar management.
   * Lists can be printed on a "plain" or Postscript printer.
   * Printing/display supports ISO 8859.1 character set.
   * List items can be logged when checked on/off with optional comments
     added to the log file.
   * List items can be retained or deleted when checked off. 
   * Multiple lists can be combined for viewing or printing.
   * Multiple lists from multiple files can be manipulated.
   * Changes to the todo list can be made and are detected by the running
     programs.

In normal use, XVTDL can be started as part of the OpenWindows startup
sequence and left running in iconic form.  If left alone, the only CPU
cycles it burns are at midnight when it "wakes up" to propagate unchecked
list items to the new day.

There is also a program -- called "tdl" -- that lists, adds entries, and 
prints todo lists from the command line.

XVTDL differs from every todo list program I have used in that (1) it
actively propagates list items, (2) it maintains multiple lists, (3) it
features recurring items, (4) it couples deadline management with list
items, and (5) it allows activity logs to be kept.  No program I have
used does all of these things and most do none of these.

XVTDL is built with XView 2.0 or higher.  TDL requires minimal routines
from XView 2.0 or higher.

See the file CHANGES for a list of changes from previous versions.

*** BETA TESTERS ***

This version was extensively beta tested by a hardy troup of testers.  
I am indebted to the beta testers, whose names appear in the file
"BETA-TESTERS" (naturally).  Please cat the file at least once and have a
brief moment of silence in gratitude to these folks for me.  Thanks!

*** FUTURE FEATURES ***

See the file "TODO" for a list of features considered for the future.
Note that this file is (naturally) in XVTDL format!

*** INSTALLATION ***

   (1) Decide on a publically accessible place for the two prolog files
       "prolog1.ps" and "prolog2.ps".  Also decide on a place for the
       help files.

   (2) Edit the either the "Makefile.std" or the "Imakefile".  The 
       changes to the macro settings should be done according to the text.  

   (3) If you are using an OS that is *not* 8-bit clean (e.g., SunOS 4.x)
       then copy lex.yy.c-8bit-kludge as below:

          cp lex.yy.c-8bit-kludge lex.yy.c

       if you desparately want to use 7-bit (non-ISO 8859.1) characters, 
       then do nothing.

   (4) If you wish to use the Imakefile, type 

            xmkmf
            make includes
            make depend

       Otherwise, you can use the Makefile.std by typing

            cp Makefile.std Makefile

   (6) Type "make".

   (7) Type "make install" if you want to install in the place indicated
       by the variables above.  Note that you must either do a "make 
       install" or move the prolog files by hand for XVTDL to
       work properly.

   (8) If you are using the Imakefile, you need to install the man pages
       by typing "make install.man".
