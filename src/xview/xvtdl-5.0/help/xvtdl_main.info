menu.
:edit
This is a menu button with the following
menu items:
  + Modify: Select a list item, then choose 
       this item. The entry editor will pop
       up and will allow you change the 
       properties of the item or cate-
       gory name.
  + Copy: Select a list item, then this item.
       A copy of the list item is placed in
       an edit buffer, ready for pasting.  One 
       cannot copy categories.
  + Cut: Select a list item, then this menu choice.
       That item is placed in an edit buffer and 
       deleted from the current list.
  + Paste: Selecting this menu item will insert 
       the contents of the edit buffer into the 
       current list.  An error will be flagged 
       if the edit buffer is empty.
  + inc priority: Selecting this choice will 
       increment the priority of the selected list
       item.  The item is incremented according to 
       the priority scheme (ascending or decending) 
       chosen in the property specification.
  + dec priority: Selecting this choice will 
       decrement the priority of the selected list
       item.  The item is decremented according to 
       the priority scheme (ascending or decending) 
       chosen in the property specification.
  + Modify Category: This menu item will cause 
       then entry editor to be started for the
       current category.  Only the name may be
       changed.
  + Delete Category: The current category may be
       deleted with this menu item.  A confirmation
       notice will be displayed to confirm the 
       user's intentions.
  + Properties...: Selecting this menu item will
       pop up the properties window.  Use of this
       window is detailed below.  Properties are
       used to manipulate the X resources
       connected with this program.  
:today
This displays the current list for the current
date.  
:listall
This is a menu button that allows special listing 
operations.  Note that this button will change 
its label, depending on how the default listing 
action on the button's menu changes.  For all 
items except "List Category", the button label 
will change to "List Cat" to allow easy redisplay 
of the current category.  For the "List Category" 
menu choice, the label will revert to "List All".  
Also, selecting an option that redisplays the todo 
list will revert the button to "List All" status.

The operations are as follows:
  + List All: This causes xvtdl to display all 
      list items from all categories in the 
      user-specified order on the todo list.  
      When this list is displayed, it can be 
      manipulated as a "normal" list from a 
      category.  Items may be checked off and 
      on -- the effect of this will be 
      reflected in the category that item 
      appears in -- and the "global list" can 
      be printed through the print window. 
  + List Tree: This will cause the tree of 
      categories rooted at the current category 
      to be displayed on one list.  Here, 
      semantics and operations are analogous to 
      those for the "List All" choice. 
  + List Parent: This choice will list the 
      contents of the parent category without 
      changing the "current" category.
  + List Category: This choice will list contents 
      of the current category on the todo list.
:print
This opens the Print window for printing lists.
:done
This causes the program to update the todo
database and close to an iconic form.  This
way is preferred for closing over using the
window menu.
:quit
This cause the program to terminate.
:todolist
This list displays the list item for the current
date.  Clicking the left mouse button on a list
item selects that item -- possibly for editing 
operations.  Double clicking on an item 
"checks off" that list item, possibly logging 
the checked off action.  Checking (by double clicking)
that item again will "check on" that item, that is,
make that item appear as a valid todo list item.
The edit menu can be recalled by pressing the
left mouse button in this area.
:calendar
The calendar area will respond to any mouse
click.  Clicking in the calendar will move the
current list to the date clicked on.  If the
mouse click is not on a number, xvtdl tries to
deduce what date would be there if the previous
or next months numbers were displayed.
:file
This button allows the user to perform several 
file operations.  They are:
  + Load: Load a different todo database into the
      program.
  + Merge: Merge a todo database file into the 
      one in memory.
  + Save: Save the in-memory todo database to a 
      file.
  + Save Cat: Save a category to a file.
