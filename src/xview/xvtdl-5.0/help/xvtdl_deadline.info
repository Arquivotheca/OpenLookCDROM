:deadline_actions
These are choice items that you turn on
or off depending on the actions you 
want taken.  The actions can be:
  * delete: delete the item after a 
       certain time 
  * + priority or - prority: For each 
       day after the deadline has past, 
       the item's priority will be 
       incremented or decremented by the 
       amount specified.
  * mail on: A message will be sent to 
       the address specified on the day 
       on which the deadline occurs.
  * mail after: A message will be sent to 
       the address specified on each day 
       after the deadline.
  * move after: The deadline will be moved 
       by the number of time units given 
       on the day after the deadline has 
       occured.

#
:deadline_cancel

#
:deadline_date
This is the specification of the deadline
date on or after which certain actions may 
occur.  A deadline may be absolute or relative.  
Absolute deadlines are given in "mm/dd/yy" 
notation (e.g., "7/8/92").  Relative deadlines
are given relative to the starting date of the 
list item (note that's not the current date -- 
especially if the item has been propagated).
Relative deadlines are give as

   <number><units>

<number> may be positive or negative.  <units> 
must be one of "d", "w", "m", or "y", indicating 
days, weeks, months, or years, respectively.  For
example, "4d" indicates 4 days from the starting 
date fo the item; "3m" specifies 3 months from the 
date of the item. 

While absolute deadlines work fine for most 
applications, relative deadlines are the best to 
use with recurring items, when the starting
date of the item depends on its recurring properties.

Deadlines are examined at propagation time,
and only at propagation time.  (Propagation occurs 
when the tool is started and at or around 
midnight each night.)
