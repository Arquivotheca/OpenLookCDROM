#  Help file for the properties window in XVTDL
#
:back_chooser
This item will pop up a color chooser
window, so that the user can choose a 
color for the "background" of XVTDL
from a pallette, rather than make a 
guess at a color name.
:back_color
This text item awaits the name of a 
color for the background of XVTDL.
:chron_direction
This item selects the way items are
organized chronologically -- if that 
criterion is specified in the sorting
specification.
:def_filename
This is the default filename for the
"print to file" selection in the print
window.
:def_print_dest
This is the default destination for a 
printer file to go to when the print
window is initialized.
:fore_chooser
This item will pop up a color chooser
window, so that the user can choose a 
color for the "foreground" of XVTDL
from a pallette, rather than make a 
guess at a color name.
:back_color
This text item awaits the name of a 
color for the foreground of XVTDL.
:log_preference
This specifies when to log an entry.
Choices are "When Checked", which allow
logging when the item is checked on or
off, "At Quit/Propagation", which logs a
checked off item when the program
propagates at midnight or the program is
terminated, or "Never", which disables
logging.
#
:log_info
This specifies the kind of information to
occur in the log file.  This can be either
"Timestamp Only", which places a timestamp
and the item string in the file without
user intervention, or "User Specified",
which constructs a minimal log entry and
starts an editor containing that entry
that the user can use to customize it.
This editor window contains an editor
window and two buttons: "Cancel" will
cancel any edits, entering the original
log entry in the log file, and "Done" will
save any edits made, entering the new
version in the log file.
#
:log_filename
This gives the name of the log file.  This
is can be a relative or absolute filename.
#
:priority_direction
This provides a way to customize what
order the user wishes priorities to be
listed: either with high = 1 down to low =
9 or with high = 9 and low = 1.  The
default situation is the latter.
#
:def_printer
This is the printer that will come up as
the default in the print window.  It is
specified here because changing the
printer in the print window does not
manipulate the X resource.
#
:def_priority
This is the priority that the "Priority:"
item in the create window is initialized to.
#
:def_print_mode
This is the printer mode (normal or
PostScript) that will come up as the
default in the print window.  It is
specified here because changing the
printer in the print window does not
manipulate the X resource.
#
:reset_button
Pressing this button will cause the window
to be reset with the current setting of X
resources.
#
:done_button
This button causes the program to reset
the X resources in the X resource database
for the user's display server and to write
the values out to the ".xvtdlrc" file to
be read next time the program is invoked.
#
:deadline_actions
These are choice items that you turn on
or off depending on the actions you 
want taken.  The actions can be:
  * delete: delete the item after a 
       certain time 
  * + priority or - prority: For each 
       day after the deadline has past, 
       the item's priority will be 
       incremented or decremented by the 
       amount specified.
  * mail on: A message will be sent to 
       the address specified on the day 
       on which the deadline occurs.
  * mail after: A message will be sent to 
       the address specified on each day 
       after the deadline.
  * move after: The deadline will be moved 
       by the number of time units given 
       on the day after the deadline has 
       occured.
#
:deadline_after_mail_to
This is the address of the person to send
a mail message to after the deadline has 
occurred.
#
:deadline_cancel
This button will cancel the actions taken
to edit or create a deadline.
#
:deadline_date
This is the specification of the deadline
date on or after which certain actions may 
occur.  A deadline may be absolute or relative.  
Absolute deadlines are given in "mm/dd/yy" 
notation (e.g., "7/8/92").  Relative deadlines
are given relative to the starting date of the 
list item (note that's not the current date -- 
especially if the item has been propagated).
Relative deadlines are give as

   <number><units>

<number> may be positive or negative.  <units> 
must be one of "d", "w", "m", or "y", indicating 
days, weeks, months, or years, respectively.  For
example, "4d" indicates 4 days from the starting 
date fo the item; "3m" specifies 3 months from the 
date of the item. 

While absolute deadlines work fine for most 
applications, relative deadlines are the best to 
use with recurring items, when the starting
date of the item depends on its recurring properties.

Deadlines are examined at propagation time,
and only at propagation time.  (Propagation occurs 
when the tool is started and at or around 
midnight each night.)
#
:deadline_delete_time
This is the number of units to wait before 
deleting the item.
#
:deadline_delete_units
This specifies the units of time -- days, weeks,
months, or years -- for the "delete" time units.
#
:deadline_done
This button will close the deadline window and 
commit the deadline specification.
#
:deadline_down_increment
This is the number of priority units to decrement
each day the deadline is past.
#
:deadline_move_after
This is the number of time units to move the 
deadline when the deadline has past.
#
:deadline_move_units
This specifies the units of time -- days, weeks,
months, or years -- for the "move after" time units.
#
:deadline_on_move_to
This is the address of the person to send
a mail message to on the day the deadline has 
occurred.
#
:deadline_up_increment
This is the number of priority units to increment
each day the deadline is past.
#
:props_category
This provides a choice in "property sheets": which
category of properties should be specified?
:sort_level1
This item selects the criterion for the first 
level of sorting.  Selecting "alpha" here makes
further levels invalid.
:sort_level2
This item selects the criterion for the second 
level of sorting.  Selecting "alpha" here makes
further levels invalid.
:sort_level3
This item selects the criterion for the last 
level of sorting.
