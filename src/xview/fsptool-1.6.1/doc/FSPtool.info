This text area, shows the current remote directory
being used. When a directory is changed then this
is updated to the new current directory. If you
edit this text yourself and then press <RETURN>
or <ENTER> the program will attempt to display
that remote directory.
#
:remote_dir_list
This area lists the files in the current remote
directory. The first entry allows you to change
directory to the parent of the current if you
double click (press SELECT twice in rapid
succession) on it. A single SELECT on a entry
selects it, selected files can be downloaded
using the Get Files option available by pressing
the MENU button here or from the "File" menu.
Double clicking on a file will cause it to be 
downloaded and passed to a program determined by
it's filetype. If the entry is a directory then
the program will change the current remote
directory to the one which has been clicked upon.
#

#

:sethost_panel
This popup allows you to set current FSP server to
use. Either through explicit use of the Host and
Port fields, or by using a host alias already in
your ~/.fsphosts file from the <Hosts> menu.
#
:sethost_clear
Selecting this button will clear the Host and
Port fields.
#
:sethost_hosts
This button provides a menu of the currently
known host aliases. Selecting one of these aliases
from the menu will fill in the Host Port and 
Remote Directory (main window) fields with the
appropriate values from the alias information.
#
:sethost_host
The address of the remote host is entered and
shown here. This can be either IP address format
such as "123.456.789.01" or a named host such as
"src.doc.ic.ac.uk".
#
:sethost_port
The port number of the remote host is entered and

field and both it and the Host field have some
contents then the program will attempt to get
directory listing from the specified remote host.
#
:sethost_apply
Selecting this button will apply the Host and Port
information, and the program will attempt to
obtain a directory listing from the remote host.
This only happens if the Host and Port fields both
have some contents.
#

:hostlist_panel
This popup shows the information contained in your
~/.fsphosts file. From here you can add new host
aliases, edit old ones and load and save to the
~/.fsphosts file.
#
:hostlist_edit
Selecting this button will have one of two
effects. If the "alias" field contains an alias
which is already known then the details in the
other fields will be applied to that alias. If it
is an unknown alias then it is treated as new and
a new alias is created with the details from the
other fields.
#
:hostlist_delete
Selecting this button will cause the currently
selected alias to be deleted. The currently
selected alias is shown by the list at the bottom
of the window, whichever has the bar on it is the
currently selected alias.
#
:hostlist_clear
Selecting this button will clear all fields in
the window, except the alias field.
#
:hostlist_load
Selecting this button will cause the ~/.fsphosts
file to be loaded, overwriting any other hosts
data.

:hostlist_save
Selecting this button will cause the current hosts
data to be saved to the file ~/.fsphosts . If the
host information has been edited and not saved
then this button will be labeled as "<Save>",
under normal circumstances when the information in
memory matches the ~/.fsphosts file it will be
"Save".
#
:hostlist_alias
This field contains the alias field for an entry,

This field contains the local directory which the
program should change to when using this site.
This feature is not currently implemented until
it is agreed where in the "taxus" format such data
could be held.
#
:hostlist_remote
This field contains the remote directory which
the program should change to when using this site.
When the host details are applied the first
directory the program will attempt to obtain will
be this one, normally this would be / the root
directory.
#
:hostlist_aliases
This is the list of known aliases, selecting one
will cause it's details to be displayed in the
areas above. The currently selected aliases is the
one which will be affected by the delete
operation.
#

:action_panel
This popup sets which applications should be run
when you elect to view a local or remote file -
either by selecting <View Selected File> or by
double-clicking on the file. The values placed
here can be saved to your defaults file and will
override any compiled in values.
#
:action_exec
This field specifies what application to start
when a file of this type is executed, either
from the local directory, or after downloading
from the remote directory. Each field should
contain the name of a program accessible to the
application at run time, which is either in the
path of the program or has a full path name
specified with it. Arguments can be specified
following the file to be executed, by default
the file which is being viewed will become the
last argument. However if you specify %f as one
of the arguments then the filename will be
inserted at that point instead.
#

:filter_panel
This popup sets the file filter values to be
applied to remote directory listings. Filetypes
which are filtered out are not shown in the
remote directory listings.
#
:filter_filter
This option determines whether file filtering is
carried out in the remote frame or not. If on then
only file types ticked in this window will be
shown in the directory listing.
#
:filter_options
Each tick corresponds to a particular filetype. If
it is ticked then it will be included in the
directory listing when file filtering is on 
otherwise it will not.
#

:aboutfsptool_panel
This popup tells you all about FSPtool, what it is
and who I am :->
#

:aboutfsp_panel
This popup will supply information on the local
FSP clients which the application is using. If a
the current remote host, remote port values are
accessing an FSP server then information on this
server will also be displayed.
#

:tool_panel
This popup sets properties for the FSPtool
application. Whether you or not you are running
an Open-Look(TM) window manager, cancel button and
popup menu selection behaviour can be altered
from here.
#
:tool_openlook
If ticked this option indicates that you are
running an OpenLook window manager (eg: olwm,
olvwm - the OpenWindows window managers). If you
are not running an OpenLook window manager then
it is probably best to unset this option so that
FSPtool can adapt it's default behaviour to suit
your window manager (eg: twm or mwm).
#
:tool_cancelclose
If set this option ensures that when a <Cancel>
button is selected the window it is in will be
closed. This is most useful with non-OpenLook
window managers, with OpenLook window managers
it will close the window regardless of the
Pushpin state.
#
:tool_menuclose
If set this option will allow windows to be
closed from their menu items. If you select the
"Transfer Status ..." menu item then that window
will be displayed, however if this option is set
and the window is already on screen then it will
be undisplayed. This provides a means for non-
OpenLook window manager users to remove frames
easily.
#
:tool_hostread
When set this option causes FSPtool to do a
directory read as soon as an item has been
selected off of the <Hosts> menu button in the
Set Host window.
#

:dirlist_panel
This popup sets the properties and behaviour of
diretory lists within FSPtool. The size of the
remote cache, timeout age of cache directories and
the sort format are all settable from here.
#
:dirlist_cachesize
The setting of this control determines the
maximum number of directories which will be cached
locally within FSPtool. To achieve the effect of
turning the cache off, set the timeout value to
zero, the minimum cache size is set at one.
#
:dirlist_cachetimeout
This control determines how old a directory cache
is allowed to become before it is considered too
old and updated. The value is settable in minutes.
Setting the timeout to zero effectively turns the
cache off.
#
:dirlist_sorttype
This option determines whether files in the remote
directory listing will be sorted in either Name,
Date/time or Size order.
#
:dirlist_alphasort
This field is active if files are being sorted in
name order. It determines whether they are sorted
in Alphabetic or Reverse-Alphabetic order.
#
:dirlist_timesort
This field is active if files are being sorted in
date order. It determines whether they are sorted
with the latest files first or with oldest files
first.
#
:dirlist_sizesort
This field is active if files are being sorted in
size order. It determines whether they are sorted
with the smallest files first or with the largest
files first.
#

:fsp_panel
This popup allows the setting of properties which
relate directly to the use of the FSP transfer
protocol. Each setting explains itself in more
details, alternatively read the documentation
which comes with the FSP distribution for more
information.
#
:fsp_buffer_size
This determines the size of the buffer which FSP
clients should use when transferring files. Most
clients and servers can manage 1024 which is the
maximum and so this can usually be used. Some
server/client combinations might be using network
links which cannot support chunks of >1024 bytes,
so in these -rare- cases you should use a lower
value.
#
:fsp_localport
This field determines which local port will be
used by the FSP clients, if at all. Normally you
should have no need to set this as the clients
will automatically find a suitable UDP socket for
themselves. If however you do set it be aware of
two factors, the number used must be between 1 and
100000 inclusive. Also if you recieve an error
message when attempting to contact the remote site
similar to "socket open: failed" then one of two
things is happening. Either you have set it to a
value which is not accessible to you or another
process is already using that socket. Try setting
it to another number, under SunOS numbers above
1000 are usually available to everyone, so try
starting there. If you save this information then
this port number will always be used each time you
run the application. To turn this off set the Port
number to 0, if this is the Port value then it is
ignored and the local port environment value is
not set. Saving the port as 0 means that the
clients will act as normal and find their own
suitable value.
#
:fsp_timeout_size
This determines the size of the timeout delay
which the FSP clients will use. It is only used if
the FSP clients were compiled with the timeout
feature turned on. The timeout is in seconds from
a minimum of one to a maximum of 10. It determines
how long the clients will wait before they decided
that the reply has timed out and probably isn't
coming. A value of 4 is reasonable and is the
default.
#
:fsp_delay_size
This determines the delay between retries in
thousands of a seconds. This acts as a base value
each successive re-try may be over a longer
period. Re-tries occur when the FSP client is not
getting a reply, it will re-try the request a
number of times with a gap based on this value
in-between until either it gets a reply or it has
decided it's tried enough and gives up.
#

:clients_panel
This popup allows you to override the compiled
in defaults for which FSP client program to use
for the various functions which FSPtool performs.
Don't adjust these unless you know what you are
doing as FSPtool will have difficulty doing
anything if these values are incorrect.
#
:clients_fver
This field specifies the name of the program
which is the fver client program. If an absolute
path is used then this will be the only program
called, if just the name such as "fver" then
the path will be searched and the first instance
of this name found will be run. This client
provides information on the local client
programs and the remote site server.
#
:clients_fls
This field specifies the name of the program
which is the flscmd client program. If an absolute
path is used then this will be the only program
called, if just the name such as "flscmd" then
the path will be searched and the first instance
of this name found will be run. This client
provides the directory listings on which
FSPtool makes up the remote file listings.
#
:clients_fget
This field specifies the name of the program
which is the fget client program. If an absolute
path is used then this will be the only program
called, if just the name such as "fgetcmd" then
the path will be searched and the first instance
of this name found will be run. This client
provides the facility to copy a file from the
remote host site.
#
:clients_fput
This field specifies the name of the program
which is the fput client program. If an absolute
path is used then this will be the only program
called, if just the name such as "fputcmd" then
the path will be searched and the first instance
of this name found will be run. This client
provides the facility to copy a file to the
remote host site.
#

:batch_panel
This popup shows the list of file which are
included in the batch transfer. The batch list
allows you to select files from various hosts
and directories add them to the list then download
the entire batch list all in one go. Useful for
when you want to browse and then leave FSPtool to
get on with the downloading.
#
:batch_transfer_button

menu of the various write options available. These
allow you to save the current batch list in
various ways, from a simple text file to a
complete shell script which can download the files
in the list. Clicking <SELECT> activates the first
of the menu options.
#
:batch_options_button
Selecting this button with <MENU> brings up a menu
of various options to process the batch list. This
includes grouping the list by host/port, deleting
entries and transfering the whole list or just
those files which you have selected. Clicking
<SELECT> activates the first of the menu options.
#
:batch_list
This list shows the files currently in the batch
transfer collection. Shown is the host and port
name of the server where the file can be found
and then the complete filename of the file.
#

:local_panel
This panel shows the directoy listing of the
current local directory to which downloading will
take place and from where uploading can be
accomplished.
#
:local_file_button
