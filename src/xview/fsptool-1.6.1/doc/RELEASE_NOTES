RELEASE NOTES (13/12/93)
------------------------

The main points to note about the current release (1.6.0) are:

  * The structure of the release has been greatly revised, to allow for
    forthcoming development.

  * An number of changes have been made to allow FSPtool to be used more easily
    in non-OpenLook Window Manager situations (eg: twm or mwm).

  * The batch list feature is now available, this enables you to select various
    files from different hosts and directories then download them all in one
    transfer operation.

  * It should now compile correctly on Solaris 2 and System V setups. The
    Solaris 2 set up is definitely ok, more general SYSV and SVR4 I haven't had
    the opportunity to try out.

  * Should now be okay for Sun-3 systems, previously there were problems when
    using FSPtool on those systems.

  * Functionality has been increased over previous versions, see "REVISIONS"
    for the gory details.

  * The ability to do limited logging of FSPtool use is now featured.

  * ~/.fsptoollayout files are no longer used (since version 1.3.0) so this
    version won't read the layout information in from that file should you have an
    old copy lying about. That's the bad news, the good news is that the
    application now has full resource management so the layout and all options can
    be saved to an ~/.fsptooldefaults file.

  * Bug reports, comments, whatever should be sent to ssudoher@uk.ac.reading

  * You can get help through the On-Line help feature provided as part of the
    OpenLook standard. Pressing the <HELP> key on your system over an item of the
    program will bring up help text of the function and use of that item. Almost
    all items in the application have some help attached to them in this manner.
    On Sun Type-4 keyboard the help key is literally <HELP> at the lower left of
    the keyboard, on other systems ask your SysAdmin which key has been defined
    for the help functionality, typically it will be <F1>. Note this Help feature
    will not work if the FSPtool.info file is not installed correctly or not
    accessible to the user at run-time.
