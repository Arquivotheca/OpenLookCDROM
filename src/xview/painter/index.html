<P>
This is a simple program that I wrote four years ago, and it no
longer works. I think it did on earlier versions of OpenWin, but
I can no longer prove it. It's just here as a demo of using
the defunct XVPS package, which was analogous to (but incompatible with)
Adobe's Display PostScript.

<P>If you make it work, please send the changes back to me
for inclusion in future versions of this distribution. Thanks!
