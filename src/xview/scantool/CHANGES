Scantool change history.
------------------------

v1.4 - patchlevel 0. - 2nd April 1990.

       * First freely available version.

       * Includes new XView graphics driver.

       * Scanning process is now a separate program.

v1.4 - patchlevel 1. - 3rd April 1990.

       * Added a SIGKILL signal handler to the scan program, so that an
         ETX character can be sent to the scanner to terminate correctly.

       * Added a destroy handler to the scantool program, so that if we
         were scanning, then the child scan process can be properly killed.

       * Scantool buttons now correctly invert.

       * WIN_STOP events are now correctly handled with the SunView version.

       * The switches have been changed to be check boxes and not panel
         choice items.

v1.4 - patchlevel 2 - 4th April 1990.        (Apply with patch -N).

       * The definitions for the bold and normal fonts were the wrong way
         around in the XView graphics driver.

       * The rasterop function for all the cursors has been set to the
         default.

       * The infinite testing loop in scan.c has been removed.

       * The use of the Stop (L1) function key has been replaced with a
         special Cancel button. WIN_STOP events don't appear to be handled
         correctly under XView.

       * The checkbox switches were not being ropped to the canvas correctly
         with the XView version.

       * The input focus was not being set to the scantool canvas when the
         mouse entered it with the XView version.

       * The width of the fonts used under SunView and XView are different,
         so the definition FONT_WIDTH has been removed and replaced with a
         variable font_width.

       * The line "cursor" used in the Set picture name routine is now
         positioned using get_strwidth instead of being hard-wired.

       * Cursors can now be correctly set with the XView version.

v1.4 - patchlevel 3 - 10th April 1990.

       * Fixed up the XView version for creating a new scanning frame.

       * Changed the rasterop function for ropgc from GXor to GXcopy.
         Button inversion now works correctly.
v1.x - general fix - 18th June 1991.
       * Make generates xview tool. To make Sunview tool, run the script
         'make.sunview'.
         Works under SunOS 4.1
