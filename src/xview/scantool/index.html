<P>This program is a front-end for a scanner.
The scan program provided is for a Microtek
MS-300A scanner, but the interface is general enough
that you could write an scanner for most any scanner.
<P>The user interface is a little strange: it was originally
a SunView application, and parts of the UI are SunView-like,
rather than OPEN LOOK. However, it's a good illustration of
how to set up a large UI and use it to drive another program.
