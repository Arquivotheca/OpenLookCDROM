.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Scan
is the program called by
.I scantool
to allow a user to scan a document using a Microtek MS300A scanner, and
turn the resulting image into a Sun rasterfile. This program could actually
be run on it's own, or through a frontend shell script, but there are a
plethora of command line options that need to be passed to the program, so
it is probably easier to run it automatically using
.I scantool.
.LP
.I Scan
can exit with a variety of different status values, a non zero value indicating
an error of some kind. There error values are:
.TP
.B "1"
Cannot open the tty port.
.TP
.B "2"
Cannot open the temporary image file.
.TP
.B "3"
Cannot open raster header file.
.TP
.B "4"
Scanner not responding aborting this scan.
.TP
.B "5"
Invalid command line argument.
.TP
.B "100 + 0xnn"
Scanning error 0xnn was received from the scanner. This scan is aborted.
.TP
.B "200 + n"
The
.I scan
program received signal
.I n
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-b " brightness"
Brightness value. There are 14 brightness values to choose from, ranging from
1 (-24% darker) to 14 (+28% lighter).

uncompressed and 1 (the default) is compressed.
.TP
.BI \-f " x1 y1 x2 y2"
Scanning frame. The frame is the area to be scanned. This option needs the
two coordinate pairs; the top left of the scanning frame, and the bottom
right. These values are expressed in 1/8" increments.
.TP
.BI \-g " grain"
Grain value. There are twelve levels of grain to choose from, ranging from
0 (grain size: 8x8, grey levels: 33) to 11 (grain size: 2x2, grey levels 5).
.TP
.BI \-m " mode"
The scanner can operate in two modes; line art mode (value 0; the default) and
halftone mode (value 1).
.TP
.BI \-p " picname"
Output picture name. This is the name of the file which will contain the
scaned image in Sun rasterfile output format. By default, the name of the
file in NoName.rf.
.TP
.BI \-r " resolution"
Resolution value. There are 16 resolution values to choose from, ranging from
0 (300 dpi, scale full size) to 15 (75 dpi, scale 25%).
.TP
.BI \-s " speed"
Speed of the serial connection between the scanner and the Sun. A value of
0 is 960 baud. A value of 1 (the default) is 1920 baud.
