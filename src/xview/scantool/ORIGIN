Here is the scantool package.

It allows connecting a Microtek MSF-300A 
monochrome flatbed scanner to a Sun workstation
for input of images into Sun rasterfiles.
Quite useful for people like Framemaker users.
I have tested it under SunOS 4.1 and except for
some minor trouble it seems to work.

It contains tools for both Xview and Sunview.

Send me a postcard if it works.

It is written by Rich Burridge at Sun in Australia and
he has released it for public use as long as no money is
made out of it. I got his permission to post it.

His address is :

Happy scanning!
