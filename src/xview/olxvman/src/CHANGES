This directory has been moved from contrib/ in R2.

Here is the list of changes to xman.  Unresolved bug fixes and
neat features are listed in the TODO file.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.1.3 -> 3.1.4 (X11 Release 4 Beta)
------------------------------------------------------------

Bug Fixes:

1) Scrolling in manual pages will not leave garbage on the screen.

2) Misc. fixes to Cray specific code.

3) Fixed umask of copy when used to put formatted manual pages into
   the standard tree.

4) I have removed the unbound mouse button actions in manual pages
   in preparation for the use of a Text widget for manual page
   display.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.1.2 -> 3.1.3 (X11 Release 4 Beta)
------------------------------------------------------------

Bug Fixes:

1) Much clean up to get things to build cleanly on various
   machines.  Cray, and HP machines needed and got the most
   work.

2) Apropos works on systems that do no have MANPATH support.
   Although it only checks /usr/man, not the entire MANPATH.

Features:

1) Compressed manual pages now fully supported.

2) Xman now warns the user if it could not find the app-defaults
   file.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.1.1 -> 3.1.2 (X11 Release 4 Alpha)
------------------------------------------------------------

Bug Fixes.

1) All fixed table sizes removed.  All memory allocation is 
   Dynamic now.
   THANKS IN PART TO:  Peter Lamb

2) SEARCHDIR is now used in all the places it sould be (I hope).

3) Xman now blows away its /tmp files when finished with them.

4) Bug in DoSearch fixed that could stomp on static
   memory.

5) Xman handles lines longer than BUFSIZ characters when displaying
   files.

6) Formatting now uses tbl and eqn.  This causes a few other problems,
   but at least formatted and unformatted manual pages will look the same.

7) Class name is now "Xman" not "XMan" to be more standard.

8) Searches no longer occasionally dump core.



Features:

1) A popup window now comes up when a manual page is formatting.  

2) Change the pointer (cursor) color is now supported with the 
   pointerColor resource.

3) Menu Item to show current version.  Version now stored in
   the binary, rather than relying on help file and binary being
   the same version.

4) Pulldown menus have been added to replace the old "Brain Dead"
   menus.  These can also be activated as popup menus with
   C-left and C-middle.

5) Actions have replaced most Callbacks this allows much more
   user customizability.

6) An app-defaults file is now used to bind events to xman actions.
   This allows users to put different actions in their own .Xresources
   file. For a full list of actions see the documentation.

   Most label names are now in the app-defaults file so they are
   customizable by the user.

9) Keyboard equivelents have been added for many actions so expert users
   need not use the option menu for most tasks.  See documentation for 
   details.

8) Typing <CR> in the Search Window now executes a manual page search.
   thus for a majority of searches no mouse action is necessary.

9) Search window clears by default if the search succeeds.
   Can be turned off with the "clearSearchString" resource.

10) Can now execute searches in the topBox, and results will
    be displayed in a new manual page. Default binding is Control-S.
    (Bob's Favorite feature :-)


   
------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.1  -> 3.1.1
------------------------------------------------------------

Bug Fixes.

1) Manual Pages now handle text properly if partially obscured.

2) Manual Pages smaller than one screen do not cause xman to die.

3) Command line arguments and resources work properly again.

4) Scrollbars on man pages and directories are the same size by default.

5) Better handling of the decision to boldify.

6) Searching with multiple manual pages visable now works correctly.

7) Resources are all in a structure, so that machines with the MSB set
   on pointers will do the right thing.  
   THANKS TO: Martin Streicher

8) Default width, is no longer dependant on the width of the display,
   but is set with #define DEFAULT_WIDTH in defs.h.  Problems may still
   occur with displays that are not 75 dpi.

9) Fixes to man.c (internal maual page finding functions)
   a) xman knows about "mano" by default now.

10) Right button paging in manual pages works correctly on all machines.

11) The box with the message "Would you like to save this formatted manpage"
    comes up correctly in the center of the manual page.

12) Manual pages of the form foo.3x11.z show up as: foo(x11).

13) Reverse video works correctly.

14) AproposFilter now uses "man -k" rather than "apropos"
    THANKS TO:  Arthur David Olson.

15) When searching for manual pages, highlight now reflects current 
    manual page.

FEATURES:

1) Overstrike is now supported.  
   THANKS TO: clyde@rutgers.edu

2) Addition to of "no default sections" option to mandesc file, read the
   latest man page for details.

3) Warning messages printed to manual page window as well as stdout.

------------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes.

    size is used.

2)  Command line syntax printed if an argument is not understood.

3)  manpage rewritten.

4)  Apropos no longer blows out with very long MANPATH's.

5)  Better handling of mandesc file.

   a) -notopbox

   c) -helpfile <filename>
	
------------------------------------------------------------

	b) 	prompt changed to:  "Type string to search for"
	c)      Remove auto popdown feature of this window.

2)      Corrected typo in Xman Options menu: "Open New . . ."

3)      Returned default to horizontal scrolling.

4)      Remember the previous state when going to "Show Both Screens"
	and return there when show one screen.

5)      Menus changed to Override Redirect due to popular demand, and
	too many confused window managers.

6)      Help File Proof read.

7)      Descenders no longer get chopped in manual page display.

8) 	Handle out of memory error more gracefully.

9) 	Help File Display Changes.
	a)	It pops up in a window much more similar to a manual page
		display.
	b)      Fix highlighting in manual page, when help file displayed.

10) 	Left over highlight in menu have been fixed.


------------------------------------------------------------
Version 3.0 (X11R2 Tape) -> Version 3.0.2
------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Features:

1) Startup time is now 3 times faster.

2) Manual page searches now SCREAM, speed MUCH improved.

3) -pagesize argument added and documented in manual page.

4) List widget used for directory, may new features of directory
   a) vertical or horizontal orientation via the "verticalList" resource
      vertical is now the default.
      e.g  xman*verticalList:        False

    b) current manual page is highlighted in the directory listing.
    c) resizing the window now creates more columns in directory 
       (see bug fix #4).
    d) Pixmaps no longer created for each directory listing.
       you people with color workstations should like this one.

5) Xman no longer uses the window widget, and it has been removed from
   the distribution.  If you want a copy send me e-mail.

Bug Fixes:

1) The height of the directory items was wrong if a different
   font is used for the directory than for the manual pages.

2) The topBox resource for the initial "Manual Browser" box now 
   can be specified.  This allows the geometry of this box to be 
   set with resources.

   e.g xman*topBox.geometry:      =100x100+2+2

3) Xman now handles the case of no help file correctly.

4) Resizing the directory now causes the columns to fill in the new area.
   This causes more of the directory to be visable in wider windows, and
   resizing narrower does not lose information.


Know bugs yet to be resolved:

1) Resizing the man page causes the directory to grow too big.
   and the manpage to get real small. (1 pixel).
