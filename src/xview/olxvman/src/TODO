BUGS:

NEAT FEATURES:

**   I miss the x10 behaviour of putting a box arround
   the currently pointed at man page when you're wandering around the
   directory.  I think you got valuable feedback that way. 

   How about a "print this manpage" command that would confirm the
   printer choice and go do a psroff -man? 

   It would be nice if "help" told you about the
   Xresources used by xman (like xman*topBox.geometry) ...

   Implement searches within manpages.

   Get a more user friendly scrollbar.

   Many man pages have a SEE ALSO section at the end.  It would be nice
   if you could parse those, and put up buttons that the user can click
   on to select one of those pages without having to switch sections and
   then pick the manpage.

** This needs to be added to the Athena List Widget.
