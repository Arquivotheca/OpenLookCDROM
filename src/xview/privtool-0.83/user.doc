		Using Privtool

Most operations in Privtool are identical to the Sun mailtool, with the
exception that attachments are not supported, some buttons don't work
and some menu items are grayed out, and there is currently no graphical
properties window (all .mailrc changes currently have to be made by
hand with a text editor). This file will simply describe the new
features.

1. Displaying messages
----------------------

When the scrolling list of messages is displayed in the Privtool window,
additional flags will appear on the left side. As well as the use of 
'N' for a new message and 'U' for an unread message, the following are
used :

Second column:
	's' - message is signed, but unverified.
	'?' - message may or may not be signed.
	'S' - message is signed, and has been succesfully verified.
	'X' - message is signed, but has a bad signature.
Third column:
	'E' - message is encrypted.
	'D' - message has been successfully decrypted.

When you double click on a message, it will be displayed in the display
window. Unlike the mailtool, the subject will be placed in the window
title, and the header will not be displayed. If the message is signed, then
signature information will be displayed in the small window at the foot
of the main display window.

If the message is encrypted, then Privtool will need your passphrase in
order to decrypt it. It may or may not actually ask you for it depending
on the security level chosen (see later for a description of security
levels).

To display the message header, press the 'header' button, and a seperate
header window will appear. The 'add key' button will be activated when
you receive a message that contains a PGP key, however at the moment it
does not do anything. In the final release it will automatically scan the
message for new keys and add them to your pubring file.

2. Sending messages
-------------------

Four new check-boxes appear on the compose window. These are in turn,
'Sign' - to sign the outgoing message, 'Encrypt' - to encrypt the
outgoing message, 'Log' - to log the outgoing message (in encrypted
form if encrypted), and 'Raw' - to log outgoing encrypted or signed
messages in raw ASCII form. You can set the defaults for these in the
.mailrc file.

When signing, Privtool may have to ask you for your passphrase, depending
on the security level chosen.

3. Security Levels
------------------

Privtool supports four security levels :

	Level 1 - read passphrase from PGPPASS
	Level 2 - ask for passphrase when first required and store it in
		memory until it is cleared either by time delay or user
		selection.
	Level 3 - ask for passphrase every time it is needed and destroy
		it as soon as possible.
	Level 4 - currently identical to level 3, in the final release it
		will delete the decrypted text of each message when you
		close the display window.

4. Mailrc options
-----------------

A whole bunch of new options have been added to the .mailrc file. A sample
is given in the file 'Mailrc.test', which may explain the system better
than I have here.

In order to retain compatibility with mail and mailtool, all Privtool-specific
options are given as comments in the .mailrc file, prior to the 'PLEASE MAKE
ALL CHANGES ABOVE THESE 2 LINES' line inserted by mailtool. Privtool
understands most of the mailtool options (specifically alias, etc), and
its options are given by lines starting with '#@'.

#@pgpkey

This allows you to specify a mapping from a mail address to a pgp key. You
MUST specify such a mapping for your own id in order to make signatures and
encrypted logging work.

#@killu

This specifies a user id to ignore mail from. The mail from this user will
be added to the deleted message list, and can be undeleted.

#@testinterval

If retrieveinterval is set to specify the time periods at which Privtool will
check for new mail in your mailbox, then you can also set testinterval to
a time in seconds. Each time Privtool checks for mail, it will also check that
a message has been displayed in the previous 'testinterval' seconds. If not,
then it will destroy your passphrase, regardless of the security level you
are running at.

#@security

This specifies the security level to use (see above). Level 2 or Level 3 are
recommended.

#@cfeed

This allows you to specify an address from which you may receive an encrypted
mailing list feed. Each time an encypted message from this address is 
decrypted, Privtool will scan the decrypted message to see if it begins with a 
valid mail header (Received: from, etc). If so, then the original message will
be junked, and the decrypted message will be put into the list in its
place. Privtool will then decrypt/verify the new message if that is
appropriate.

And yes, this *does* work with the encrypted Cypherpunks mailing list 
feed.

5. ToDo
-------

Features to be added :

	Support for remailers.

	Support for multiple pseudonyms.

	Graphical .mailrc properties window.

	Hopefully a Motif or Xt replacement for x.c.

	Support for key management.

	Improved security in general.

	Create color icon.

	Add multiple compose and display windows.

See README.1ST for other information on current bugs and intended fixes.

6. Security concerns
--------------------

I'm not sure how good the random number generation is at the moment, it
essentially keeps an array of user interface interaction times and
passes it to the PGP Tools random number functions (the old array will
be stored as 'privseed.bin' in your $PGPPATH).

Another major concern is that if you mail out an encrypted message to
several people it will be encrypted to all those people rather than
encrypted to each individually, hence any recipient will be able to
get the entire list of recipients by looking at the PGP headers. In
addition, when you encrypt a message to send and also log it in
'cooked' (i.e. non-raw) fashion, the message that is sent and logged
will also be encrypted to you, so any recipient will be able to determine
that you are the sender. This is not so much of a problem when you
are not using remailers, but will be fixed for the PGP Tools version
of Privtool in the final release.

Finally, the XView toolkit has a tendency to dump displayed messages in 
ASCII files in /tmp where other people may be able to read them. There
doesn't appear to be much I can do about this without rewriting XView.
