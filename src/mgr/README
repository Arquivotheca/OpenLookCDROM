*  This is the almost finished integrated color/mono version of MGR.  It
   has its own 1-bit and 8-bit bit-blit code, so it is not dependent upon
   pixrect for color support.  Its goal is to provide seamless integration
   between color and monochrome operation.  In theory you should be able
   to build the following versions with this code:

	* Mono (1 bit pixels), with own bitblit code
	* color, with pixrect code
	* color with own code.

*	Unlike the previous versions of color MGR, this one supports
	cut/paste.

*	I have tried to keep a pixrect compatible version working, as that is
	the only way I know of to use the SUN frame buffers in other than dumb
	memory mapped mode (Thanks Sun! What open systems?).

*	Since I haven't had time to work on this version since 10/92, I'm
	releasing it in its sort-of-working but buggy state.  It actually works
	quite well on the Tadpole SparcBook.

*  This release only includes the sources for MGR proper.  As usual,
   suggestions and comments are welcome.

*  Some of the enhancements and bug fixes never made it into this version.

*  The comments in the Makefile (in new_src) are incorrect, use "make colormgr"
