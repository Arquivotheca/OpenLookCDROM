ch08 contains the following examples programs:

xmotdbltst:	tests motion events and double clicks in the same 
   		translation table to show that this is erratic

xtryaccel:	adds accelerators to xbox1 so that 'q' and 'p' 
   		invoke actions from anywhere in the application -- note that
   		this example uses the Athena widgets because it does not 
		work in Motif because Motif modifies translation and 
   		accelerator tables internally
