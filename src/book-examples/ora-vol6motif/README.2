This distribution is designed to build under R5.
The build process uses imake, and assumes that Motif 1.2
(or Motif 1.1.4) is already built and installed.

To rebuild the Makefile using already installed
libraries, use xmkmf as follows:

xmkmf

If the libraries are still installed in the X source tree, use:

xmkmf TOP

where TOP is the full path of the mit directory of your X distribution
sources.

Alternately, use the ximake.sh shell script provided
in the TOP/util/scripts directory, something like the following:

TOP/util/scripts/ximake.sh -i TOP

where TOP is the full path of the mit directory of your X distribution
sources.

Without the -i flag, the Makefile will use libraries and include 
files in the X source tree.  This will only work if you have built the
Core distribution and have not yet cleaned out all the object
files and libraries from the source tree.  However, many people
clean out these files after installing the executables and libraries
in order to make disk space for compiling things in contrib.
So normally you want to use -i, or xmkmf alone.

If you want to compile the programs with -g to let you debug using
a debugger such as dbx, use:

make "CC=cc -g"

If you do not have the sources for X, you may not have the
ximake.sh script, and you may not have the configuration files
that \f(CWimake\fP requires.  If this is the case, you can try
the provided default Makefiles, or you can compile manually:

cc -g -o progname progname.c -lXm -lXt -lXext -lX11
