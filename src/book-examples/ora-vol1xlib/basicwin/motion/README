basicmot.c gets all motion events, and draws points everywhere the
mouse moves.

motionhint.c uses motion hints to get only occasional button events
events.  

There is no working example for motion history because it 
doesn't work on my server (or most others for that matter).

Both programs implement a simple drawing program in their subwindow.
