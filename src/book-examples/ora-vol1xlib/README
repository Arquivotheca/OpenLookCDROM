This directory contains most of the examples used in O'Reilly and
Associates' Xlib Programming Manual.  All the complete routines
and many of the fragments are provided here, all within working 
programs.  (Some of the smallest code fragments are not included.)

This distribution builds under R3, R4, and R5, and
has been tested on BSD and System V machines.

The examples for R5 features such as Xcms and 
Internationalization are in the r5 directory.

The basicwin directory includes numerous versions of a hello-world
application, each demonstrating different X features.  Exactly what
each demonstrates is not always obvious by running the program - see 
the README file in each directory and look at the code.

This directory also includes the major applications described in the 
book, \fIwinman\fR and \fIbasecalc\fR.  \fIwinman\fR is a very simple
window manager (not updated to the current ICCCM), and basecalc is a 
calculator still useful for converting numbers between bases and for 
doing binary, octal, and hexadecimal math.
The winman and basecalc applications will be installed if you type 
"make install".
