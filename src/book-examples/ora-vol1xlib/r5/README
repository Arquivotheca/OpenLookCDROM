This directory contains example code to accompany the book
"X Window System Programmer's Supplement for Release 5" from
O'Reilly & Associates.

The programs are the following:

  o scalefont.c -- a demo of font scaling.  It contains the code
    from Examples 2-5 and 2-6.

  o xcms.c -- a demo of device independent color allocation and
    gamut querying with the TekHVC color space.  It contains the
    code from Example 3-6.

  o i18n_output.c -- a demo of internationalized text output.
    It contains the code from Example 4-5.

  o i18n_input.c -- a demo of internationalized text input.  It
    contains code from many of the examples in Chapter 5.

To build these programs, first create a Makefile by typing:

	xmkmf <top>

where <top> is the top of the X11R5 source tree.  Then build
the programs by typing:

	make all

Each source file begins with a long comment which gives more
information about the program and provides instructions for 
running it.

If you have any difficulties building or running these
programs, please let me know.  You can send me electronic
mail at either of the following addresses:

	david@ora.com
	uunet!ora!david

Enjoy!
