:Canvas:
The Meminfo tool displays information about the
Linux system. The information is obtained from
services provided by the kernel through the /proc
filesystem interface.

The information is updated on regular intervals,
which can be specified by the user (within certain
limits).
:UpdateInput:
You can modify the interval between updates using
this numerical input. The number specifies the
number of seconds between updates. The more often
the information is updated, the more closely you
are able to follow the changes. On the other hand,
the tool eats more resources with very short
intervals.

Allowed range: 0-60, where 0 means a 0.5 second
interval.

:UptimeText:
The uptime displays how long since the system was
started. 

:UsedGauge:
This gauge shows how much RAM memory is in use at
the moment. This amount is the total amount,
including shared data, file buffers and private
data, but excluding memory occupied by the kernel
or swapped to disk.

The ticks on the side roughly correspond to 1 MB
memory.

:SharedGauge:
This gauge shows how much RAM memory is being
shared by more than one program. The larger this
value is, the more efficiently your memory is
being used.

:BuffersGauge:
The "Buffers" gauge shows the amount of memory
occupied by file system buffers. The linux kernel
dynamically changes the size of the buffer,
depending on RAM size, other programs. etc.

The larger the buffer size is, the more
information can be cached in memory, thus
speeding up disk accesses.

:SwapGauge:
The "Swap" gauge shows how much of the disk swap
space is in use. If this value is significant,
your system will slow down because data has to be
paged to disk.

The gauge helps you determine if you need to buy
more RAM, or allocate more disk swap.

:Load1Gauge:
The "1 Min" gauge shows the load average
calculated by the kernel over 1 minute. The
load average is usually thought to represent
the number of processes in the run queue.

The gauge max value is 4, but the load average
can in exterme cases go over this (arbitrarely
chosen) value.

:Load5Gauge:
The "5 Min" gauge shows the load average
calculated by the kernel over 5 minutes. The load
average is usually thought to represent the number
of processes in the run queue, on average during
the time interval.

The gauge max value is 4, but the load average can
in exterme cases go over this.

:Load15Gauge:
The "15 Min" gauge shows the load average
calculated by the kernel over the last 15 minutes.
The load average is usually thought to represent
the number of processes in the run queue, on
average during the time interval.

The gauge max value is 4, but the load average can
in exterme cases go over this.

:MemInfo:
The memory value displayed is the number of bytes
available for user space data. The RAM occupied by
the linux kernel is not included in the value.

:SwapInfo:
The swap total value shows how many bytes of disk
swap space is configured. 

:LoadInfo:
The system load is represented by three gauges,
which show the average load during a 1, 5, and
15 minute period.

:UsedValue:
This value shows how much RAM memory is in use at
the moment. The same information is shown
graphically by the gauge above.

:SharedValue:
This value shows how much RAM memory is shared by
more than one program at the moment. The same
information is shown graphically by the gauge above.

:BuffersValue:
This value shows how much RAM memory is occupied
by file system buffers at the moment. The same
information is shown graphically by the gauge above.

:SwapValue:
This value shows how much memory is paged out to
the swap area(s) on disk at the moment. The same
information is shown graphically by the gauge above.

:Load1Value:
This value shows the load average during a 1
minute interval. It is a floating point value,
where 0 means no system load.

The value has no specific upper limit, but the
value seldom goes over 10 even in very loaded
systems.

:Load5Value:
This value shows the load average during a 5
minute interval. It is a floating point value,
where 0 means no system load.

The value has no specific upper limit, but a
value that often goes over 4 might mean it's
time to upgrade your system.

:Load15Value:
This value shows the load average during a 15
minute interval. It is a floating point value,
where 0 means no system load.

The value has no specific upper limit, but a
value that often goes over 4 might mean it's
time to upgrade your system (or get a life :-)
