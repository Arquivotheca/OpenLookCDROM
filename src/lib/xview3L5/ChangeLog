Changes xview3L5 -> xview3L5.1 (bugfix release, Oct-93)
------------------------------
- olwm left zombies. Fixed
- libUICSS DLL library caused core dumps. Fixed
- perf binary in 3L5 was buggy. Now included the latest version
- Some UIT examples used 'CC' as compiler. Without a link CC->g++ this
  won't work. Changed CC to g++ in the relevant makefiles.
- base.h and notify.h defined SYSV_UCONTEXT. Made some changes to
  avoid needing sys/ucontext.h, which linux doesn't have.
- Updated the SlingShot library with an unoffical patch by Michael Lake
  <jmlake@uiuc.edu>, which fixes some memory allocation problems.
- Fixed bug in handling of menu items. Sometimes a menu item would be
  clobbered due to using freed memory in the xview panel package.
- Updated install script to check for /etc/ld.so.conf, and update it if 
  necessary. Binaries are not compiled with ld.so, though, to avoid
  forcing people to update at this point in time.

Changes xview3L4 -> xview3L5 (Sep-93)
----------------------------
- XView updated to source release 3.2 patchlevel 1 from Sun.
- Slingshot library updated to patchlevel 4.
- UIT library updated to release 3.
- Props and textedit not present in XView3.2. Use code from 3.0 as before.
- Linux Meminfo updated to v1.1 (bugfix).
- Include xview example sources.
- Include patches and jumpfiles for linux shared libraries, and a README
  on how to use them.
- 8-bit character support in textedit.
- Modified scrolling algorithm for cmdtool(1). Should now be a bit quicker.
  Shelltool is still intolerably slow.
- xtoolplaces now correctly accepts command line arguments
- Wrote manpages for owplaces(1) and openwin(1)
- Included binary of 'perf' by Rudolf Koenig
  <rfkoenig@immd4.informatik.uni-erlangen.de>
- Modified default Xdefaults file for keyboard accelerators

Changes xview3L3 -> xview3L4
----------------------------
- Main reason for release is to use the DLL X-libraries. Previous
  release was statically linked with X. The libraries are now created
  with the new shlib-tools, and are DLL (Dynamic Link Libraries).
- New version of the UIT library. This is a beta release from Sun with
  better support for g++ (grabbed from export.lcs.mit.edu). Now 
  includes a DLL version of libUIC.
- Slingshot library updated with three patches to v.2pl3.
- Include xtoolplaces as a replacement for owplaces. This means the
  "Save Workspace" menu item in the rootmenu now works.
  (thanks to mrb@dtro.e-technik.th-darmstadt.de for the linux port)
- Include new .xinitrc to work with both startx and openwin startup
- Include xview config files /usr/openwin/lib/config.
- Include a sample xmodmap file for the keys used by the window managers
  which are available on Sun Type 4 keyboards, e.g "Help", "Find", "Cut"
  "Copy" and "Paste".
- Include UIT example sources.
- Changed installation: Ask if static libs are to be installed.
  Static libs occupy lots of diskspace, and may not be needed by all.
- All libraries now live in /usr/openwin/lib. To link xview apps the
  library search path should now include -L/usr/openwin/lib.
- Previous releases had truncated filenames due to the minix filesystem.
  Should now be fixed.

Changes xview3L2 -> xview3L3
----------------------------
- Fixed bug in ttysw package which affected cmdtool/shelltool. The
  problem was in pty handling, which didn't work properly. One
  of the symptoms was a nonworking <Ctrl>-C. Updated the minor version
  of libxv3.so.1 from 0 to 1 due to this.
- Olwm didn't wait on it's children properly, causing zombies for
  processes started from the Workspace menu.
- Including olvwm (virtual window manager), based on olvwm 3 patchlevel 3.
- Static versions of libolgx and libxview included due to request.
- The xview "images" directory included, some applications want icons.
- Stub libraries are now called /usr/lib/libXXX.sa instead of
  /usr/lib/shlib/jump/libXXX.a. A reasonably new ld(1) is needed,
  when building XView applications.
- All libraries recompiled with gcc 2.3.3, updated jump table versions
  from 1.0 to 1.1
- Included a Xinitrc, to make installation even more failsafe.
- Included a kludgy port of the User Interface Toolkit (UIT), a C++
  class library based on XView. Static lib only, G++ complains about
  class declarations when building UIT apps.
- Two example programs built with UIT, "Hello World", and "Linux Meminfo"

Changes xview3 -> xview3L2
--------------------------
- The libraries are now jump libraries (linux flavor of shared libraries).
  This means *MUCH* smaller binaries, here are some examples:
  'clock' before: 951300 bytes. Now: 33796 bytes (both stripped)
  'olwmslave' before: 947204 bytes. Now: 91140 bytes (both stripped)
  The binaries would be even smaller if it wasn't for one library not
  yet available as shared, the RPC library.
- The Slingshot extensions are now included. This is Slingshot v2.0
  recently (Nov-92) released by Sun.
- The cursor keys now work in cmdtool/shelltool for command line history
  and vi.
- A small bug in the olgx library fixed. It affected the scrollbar
  cables, which would in some cases extend over their limits.
- Slightly modified termcap entry.
- Some errors in the provided Workspace menu files have been fixed. Also
  added a menu for the Slingshot example programs.
- The 'fd_set' has changed in linux from a long-int to an array between
  kernel 0.98 and 0.98p5. Updated the XView libraries to reflect this
  (in effect removed some patches that were needed before :-)
- Patches to XView not included anymore. They would increase the size
  of this package even further, and are probably not interesting to
  most people anyway. Available on request.
