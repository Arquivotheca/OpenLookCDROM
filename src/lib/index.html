<P>We are lucky that Sun have released the XView source code
for public release. It is not "public domain", they hold the
copyright to it, but you can do anything you want with it.
Here we have two complete implementations of XView, plus several
additional bits and pieces:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="xview3L5">xview3L5</A>, Kenneth Osterberg's
<lmfken@lmf.ericsson.se> package of XView libraries (and binaries) for Linux
<LI><A HREF="xview3.2p1-X11R6-LinuxElf">xview3.2p1-X11R6-LinuxElf</a>, a
complete XView source distribution ready for compiling with ELF.
<LI><A HREF="SlingShot">SlingShot additions to XView</A>
<LI><A HREF="UIT">UIT, the User Interface Toolkit</A>
