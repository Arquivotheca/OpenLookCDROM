.SH NAME
ppmtoxpm - convert a portable pixmap into an X11 pixmap
.SH SYNOPSIS
ppmtoxpm [-name <xpmname>] [-rgb <rgb-textfile>] [<ppmfile>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable pixmap as input.
Produces X11 pixmap  (version 3) as output which
can be loaded directly by the XPM library.
.PP
The \fB-name\f option allows one to specify the prefix string which is printed
in the resulting XPM output.  If not specified, will default to the
filename (without extension) of the <ppmfile> argument.
If \fB-name\f is not specified and <ppmfile>
is not specified (i.e. piped input), the prefix string will default to
the string "noname".
.PP
The \fB-rgb\f option allows one to specify an X11 rgb text file for the
lookup of color name mnemonics.  This rgb text file is typically the
/usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt of the MIT X11 distribution, but any file using the
same format may be used.  When specified and
a RGB value from the ppm input matches a RGB value from the <rgb-textfile>,
then the corresponding color name mnemonic is printed in the XPM's colormap.
If \fB-rgb\f is not specified, or if the RGB values don't match, then the color
will be printed with the #RGB, #RRGGBB, #RRRGGGBBB, or #RRRRGGGGBBBB
hexadecimal format.
.PP
All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
.PP
For example, to convert the file "dot" (found in /usr/include/X11/bitmaps),
from xbm to xpm one could specify
.IP
xbmtopbm dot | ppmtoxpm -name dot
.PP
or, with a rgb text file (in the local directory)
.IP
xbmtopbm dot | ppmtoxpm -name dot -rgb rgb.txt
.SH BUGS
An option to match the closest (rather than exact) color name mnemonic
from the rgb text would be a desirable enhancement.
.PP
Truncation of the least significant bits of a RGB value may result in
nonexact matches when performing color name mnemonic lookups.
