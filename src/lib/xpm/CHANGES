3.2g	(93/04/26)

    ENHANCEMENTS:
	- much faster close colors
	- piping from/to compressed files now handles GNU's gzip (.z)  format
	- added XpmColorKey attribute - ability to specify which visual's
	  colors to use (ie: now it's possible to read in a pixmap in a
	  color visual, but use the colors specified for monochrome).
	- added -mono, -grey4, -grey and -color options to sxpm to demonstrate
	  the XpmColorKey attribute.
		- Jason Patterson <jasonp@fitmail.qut.edu.au>

    BUGS CORRECTED:
	- fixed bug where redefining "None" as a pixel stopped mask generation
	- minor SVR4 defines for <string.h>
	- fixed annoying closecolor bug related to read/write color cells
	- fixed minor bug in color value -> pixel overloading
	- manual updated to include new red/green/blue closeness attributes
		- Jason Patterson <jasonp@fitmail.qut.edu.au>

	- the top Imakefile was missing the depend target
	- sxpm/Imakefile fixed so that -L../lib is set before the standard
	  library location.
		- Vivek Khera <khera@cs.duke.edu>

	- lib/xpmP.h now defines bcopy as memcpy for VMS (required by recent
	  versions of VMS)
		- J. Daniel Smith <dsmith@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com>

	- the lib/Imakefile didn't work with X11R4.


3.2f		(93/03/17)

    NEW FEATURES:
	- the library provides four new functions to deal with Xpm files
	  loaded in memory as single character strings buffers:

			XpmCreateImageFromBuffer
			XpmCreatePixmapFromBuffer
			XpmCreateBufferFromImage
			XpmCreateBufferFromPixmap

	- in addition, as a convenience, two functions are provided to copy a
	  file in a buffer and to write a file from a buffer:

			XpmReadFileToBuffer
			XpmWriteFileFromBuffer

    ENHANCEMENTS:
	- Files are now dispatched in the following sub-directories:
	  lib, sxpm, and doc.
	- Imakefiles will let you build a shared library as well as the static
	  one (with either X11R4 or X11R5).
	- The documentation has been ported from LaTeX to FrameMaker and is
	  now included in the distribution in its PostScript form (doc/xpm.ps).
	  Source files are available on request.
	  Also the documentation has been reoreganized and includes a table of
	  contents and an index of the functions (the number of functions
	  increasing this became a requisite).

    BUGS CORRECTED:
	- Many warnings have been fixed - patch from Daniel Dardailler 
	  daniel@osf.org

3.2e		(93/02/05)

    ENHANCEMENTS:
	- use XpmMalloc, XpmRealloc, XpmCalloc, and XpmFree which are defines
	in xpmP.h. This should help people wanting to use their own functions.

    BUGS CORRECTED:
	- Intrinsic.h is no longer included.
	- bzero is defined as memset on SYSV and SVR4.
	- some memory initialisation bug concerning XpmAttributes.

3.2d		(93/01/27)

    ENHANCEMENTS:
    	- compile on Solaris 2.0
		- patch from Clint Jeffery <cjeffery@cs.arizona.edu>

    BUGS CORRECTED:
	- shape masks are now set correctly for LSBFirst (Decs).
	- pixmaps are now set correctly for 2 bit displays (Nexts).
		- patch from Josef Leherbauer <joe@takeFive.co.at>
	- isspace was called on getc which fails when EOF is returned.
		- Marelli Paolo <marelli@colos3.usr.dsi.unimi.it>

3.2c		(92/12/29)

    ENHANCEMENTS:
    	- parsing optimized for single and double characters color
		- patch originally from Martin Brunecky 
				       marbru@build1.auto-trol.com

    BUGS CORRECTED:
	- XpmFreeExtensions was calling free on some argument without checking
	it was not NULL.
	- strdup was not correctly defined for systems which do not provide
	it.	- Hans-Peter Lichtin <lich@zellweger.ch>
	- some bug in XpmCrDataFI.c
	        - Sven Delmas garfield@avalanche.cs.tu-berlin.de

    NOTE:
    	- there is still a bug with the creation of the clipmask on display of
	depth 2 but I can't find a fix because unfortunately I don't have such
	a rendering system and nobody gets the time to investigate for me.

3.2b		(92/10/19)

    ENHANCEMENTS:
	- Create XpmReadFileToData and XpmWriteFileFromData
		- Dan Greening <dgreen@sti.com>
    	- added "close colors" support and ability to redefine color values
	  as pixels at load time, as well as color names
		- Jason Patterson <jasonp@fitmail.qut.edu.au>
	- errors while parsing or allocating colors now revert to other
	  visual defaults, creating pixmap/image as expected, and returning
	  XpmSuccess. The old behaviour of XpmColorError being returned and no
	  pixmap/image being created can be retained by setting the
	  exactColors attribute.
		- Jason Patterson <jasonp@fitmail.qut.edu.au>

    BUGS CORRECTED:
	- SVR4 defines for including <string.h> instead of <strings.h>
		- Jason Patterson <jasonp@fitmail.qut.edu.au>
	- attributes->extensions and attributes->nextensions fields were not 
	  set correctly when no extensions present in file.
		- Simon_Scott Cornish <cornish@ecr.mu.oz.au>

3.2a		(92/08/17)

    ENHANCEMENTS:
    	- use the mock lisp hashing function instead of the gnu emacs one,
	it is faster in some cases and never slower (I've not found any case).

    BUGS CORRECTED:
	- function prototypes for ansi compilers.
	- some memory initialization bugs (purify is just great for this).
	- empty strings in extensions are now correctly handled.

3.2		(92/07/06)

    NEW FEATURES:
	- both format and functions handle extensions data. This allow people
	to store additional data related to a pixmap. See documentation for
	detail.
	- sxpm supports the new option '-c' to use a private colormap. This is
	useful when displaying pixmaps using a lot of colors.
	- sxpm supports the new option '-v' (verbose) to get possible
	extensions print out on standard error.

    ENHANCEMENTS:
    	- most of the code has been reworked to be improved and thus almost
	every function is faster. It takes less than 6 seconds of real time on
	a sun4 to display, with sxpm, a 487x635 pixmap using 213 colors, while
	it takes 32 seconds with the old library! It takes 18 seconds to
	display a 1279x1023 screen dump using 14 colors while xwud takes 10
	seconds.
	Of course performance improvements are not always that great, they
	depend on the size and number of colors but I'm sure everybody will
	appreciate ;-)
	I know how to improve it more but this will require changes in the
	architecture so this is not for now. Some optimizations have been
	contributed by gregor@kafka.saic.com (gregg hanna) and
	jnc@csl.biosci.arizona.edu (John N. Calley).
	- the Imakefile is modified to let you install sxpm - Rainer Klute
           <klute@irb.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>
	- xpmP.h declares popen for Sequent platforms - Clinton Jeffery
	   <cjeffery@cs.arizona.edu>
	- XpmWriteFileFromImage/Pixmap rather than truncating the pixmap name
	to the first dot changes dots to underscores to get a valid C syntax
	name.


    BUGS CORRECTED:
	- there was a bug in the image creation function for some 24 bits
	displays. It is fixed.
	- allocated color pixels are now freed when an error occurs -
	   nusser@dec1.wu-wien.ac.at (Stefan Nusser)

    CHANGES TO THE DOC:
	- the documentation describes the new XpmExtension structure and how
	to use it with read and write functions.

3.1		(92/02/03)

    ENHANCEMENTS:
    	- sxpm now have more standard options (mainly suggested by 
	Rainer Sinkwitz <sinkwitz@ifi.unizh.ch>):

	Usage:  sxpm [options...]
	Where options are:

	[-d host:display]            Display to connect to.
	[-g geom]                    Geometry of window.
	[-hints]                     Set ResizeInc for window.
	[-icon filename]             Set pixmap for iconWindow.
	[-s symbol_name color_name]  Overwrite color defaults.
	[-p symbol_name pixel_value] Overwrite color defaults.
	[-plaid]                     Read the included plaid pixmap.
	[filename]                   Read from file 'filename', and from
				     standard input if 'filename' is '-'.
	[-o filename]                Write to file 'filename', and to standard
				     output if 'filename' is '-'.
	[-nod]                       Don't display in window.
	[-rgb filename]              Search color names in the rgb text file
				     'filename'.

	if no input is specified sxpm reads from stdandard input.


	- Xpm functions and Ppm converters now deal with multiword colornames.
	  patches from Rainer Sinkwitz <sinkwitz@ifi.unizh.ch>.


3.0		(91/10/03)

	Functions name and defines have been modified again (sorry for that)
	as follows:

	     XpmReadPixmapFile    XpmReadFileToPixmap
	     XpmWritePixmapFile   XpmWriteFileFromPixmap

	     XpmPixmapColorError  XpmColorError
	     XpmPixmapSuccess     XpmSuccess
	     XpmPixmapOpenFailed  XpmOpenFailed
	     XpmPixmapFileInvalid XpmFileInvalid
	     XpmPixmapNoMemory    XpmNoMemory
	     XpmPixmapColorFailed XpmColorFailed

	To update code using Xpm you can use the included shell script called
	rename with the sed commands files name-3.0b-3.0c and name-3.0c-3.0.
	Old names still valid though.

    NEW FEATURES:
	- four new functions to work with images instead of pixmaps:

	     XpmReadFileToImage
	     XpmWriteFileFromImage
	     XpmCreateImageFromData
	     XpmCreateDataFromImage

    ENHANCEMENTS:
    	Algorithms to create and scan images and pixmaps are based on the
	MIT's R5 code, thus they are much cleaner than old ones and should
	avoid any problem with any visual (yes, I trust MIT folks :-)

    BUGS CORRECTED:
	Imakefile use INCDIR instead of ROOTDIR.

    CHANGES TO THE DOC:
	- the documentation presents the four new functions.

3.0c		(91/09/18)

	In answer to request of people functions, types and defines names have
	been changed as follows:

	     XCreatePixmapFromData	 XpmCreatePixmapFromData
	     XCreateDataFromPixmap	 XpmCreateDataFromPixmap
	     XReadPixmapFile		 XpmReadPixmapFile
	     XWritePixmapFile		 XpmWritePixmapFile
	     XFreeXpmAttributes		 XpmFreeAttributes

	     PixmapColorError		 XpmPixmapColorError
	     PixmapSuccess		 XpmPixmapSuccess
	     PixmapOpenFailed		 XpmPixmapOpenFailed
	     PixmapFileInvalid		 XpmPixmapFileInvalid
	     PixmapNoMemory		 XpmPixmapNoMemory
	     PixmapColorFailed		 XpmPixmapColorFailed

	     ColorSymbol		 XpmColorSymbol

	Generally speaking every public name begins with 'Xpm' and every
	private one with 'xpm'. This should avoid any possible conflict.

	Some files have also be renamed accordingly.

    NEW FEATURES:
	- support for VMS and two new options for sxpm: icon and hints (see
	manual for details) Richard Hess <rhess%pleione%cimshop@uunet.UU.NET>
	- DEFINES in Imakefile and Makefile.noXtree allows you to set the
	following:

	    	 ZPIPE for un/compressing piped feature (default is on)
		 NEED_STRCASECMP for system which doesn't provide one (default
				 is off)

	- xpmtoppm.c has is own strstr function which is used if NEED_STRSTR
	is defined when compiling - Hugues.Leroy@irisa.fr (Hugues Leroy).
	
    BUGS CORRECTED:
	- many bugs have been fixed, especially for ansi compilers -
	       Doyle C. Davidson (doyle@doyled.b23b.ingr.com) and
	       Clifford D. Morrison (cdm%bigdaddy%edsr@uunet.UU.NET)
	- parser is again a little more improved

3.0b		(91/09/12)

	This is a complete new version with a new API and where files and
	structures have been renamed. So this should be taken as a new
	starting release.
	This release should be quickly followed by the 3.0 because I'm planning
	to send it for X11R5 contrib which ends October 5th.

    NEW FEATURES:
	- support for transparent color.
	- support for hotspot.
	- a new function: XCreateDataFromPixmap to create an XPM data from a
	pixmap in order to be able to create a new pixmap from this data using
	the XCreatePixmapFromData function later on.
	- a new structure: XpmAttributes which replace the XpmInfo structure
	and which leads to a much simpler API with less arguments.
	- arguments such as visual, colormap and depth are optionnal, default
	values are taken if omitted.
	- parsing and allocating color failures don't simply break anymore. If
	another default color can be found it is used and a PixmapColorError
	is returned. In case no color can be found then it breaks and returns
	PixmapColorFailed.
	- for this reason the ErrorStatus codes are redefined as follows:

		   null     if full success
		   positive if partial success
		   negative if failure

	with:
		#define PixmapColorError    1
		#define PixmapSuccess       0
		#define PixmapOpenFailed   -1
		#define PixmapFileInvalid  -2
		#define PixmapNoMemory     -3
		#define PixmapColorFailed  -4

	- sxpm prints out a warning when a requested color could not be parsed
	or alloc'ed, and an error when none has been found.
	- sxpm handles pixmap with transparent color. For this purpose the
	plaid_mask.xpm is added to the distribution.

    BUGS CORRECTED:
	- I've again improved the memory management.
	- the parser is also improved.
	- when writting a pixmap to a file the variable name could be
	"plaid.xpm" which is not valid in C. Now the extension name is cut off
	to give "plaid" as variable name.
	- reading multiple words colornames such as "peach puff" where leading
	to non readable Xpm files. They are now skipped to have only single
	word colorname. Lionel Mallet (mallet@ipvpel.unipv.it).
	- parser was triggered by the "/" character inside string.
	Doyle C. Davidson (doyle@doyled.b23b.ingr.com). This is corrected.
	- sxpm maps the window only if the option "-nod" is not selected. 

    CHANGES TO THE DOC:
	- the documentation presents the new API and features.

3.0a		(91/04/10)

	This is an alpha version because it supports the new version of XPM,
	but the library interface is still the same. Indeed it will change in
	future release to get rid of obsolete stuff such as the type argument
	of the XWritePixmapFile function.

    ******************************* WARNING *********************************
	The format is not anymore XPM2, it is XPM version 3 which is XPM2
	limited to the C syntax with the key word "XPM" in place of "XPM2 C".
	The interface library has not changed yet but the type argument of
	XWritePixmapFile and the type member of XpmInfo are not used anymore.
	Meanwhile the library which is now called libXpm.a is backward
	compatible as XPM2 files can be read. But the XWritePixmapFile
	function only writes out XPM version 3 files.
    *************************************************************************

    NEW FEATURES:
	- the library doesn't use global variables anymore, thus it should be
	able to share it.
	- sxpm has been rewritten on top of Xt, it can be used to convert
	files from XPM2 to XPM version 3.
	- xpm1to2c.perl has been upgraded to the new XPM version and renamed
	as xpm1to3.perl
	- ppmtoxpm2.c and ppmtoxpm2.1 have been upgraded too and renamed
	ppmtoxpm.c and ppmtoxpm.1. In addition the xpmtoppm.c and xpmtoppm.1
	of the pbmplus package have been upgraded too. xpmtoppm can thus
	convert XPM version 1 and 3 to a portable pixmap. These files should
	replace the original ones which are part of the pbmplus package. See
	the ppm.README file for more details.
	- the library contains RCS variables which allows you to get revision
	numbers with ident (which is part of the RCS package). The Id number
	is an internal rcs number for my eyes only. The official one is found
	in Version.

    BUGS CORRECTED:
	- the memory management has been much improved in order to avoid
	memory leaks.
	- the XImage building algorythm has been changed to support correctly
	different visual depths. There is special code to handle depths 1, 4,
	6, 8, 24, and 32 to build the image and send it in one whack, and
	other depths are supported by building the image with XPutPixel which
	is slow but sure.
	- similar algorithms are used to read pixmaps and write them out.

    CHANGES TO THE DOC:
	- the documentation presents the new XPM format.


2.8		(90/12/19)

    ******************************* WARNING *********************************
        Since the last release two structures have been modified and have now
	bigger sizes, so ANY CODE USING THE libXPM2 NEEDS TO BE RECOMPILED.
    *************************************************************************

    NEW FEATURES:
	- the ColorSymbol struct contains the new member 'pixel' which allow
	to override default colors by giving a pixel value (in such a case
	symbol value must be set to NULL),
	- the XpmInfo struct contains the new member 'rgb_fname' in which one
	can specify an rgb text file name while writing a pixmap with the 
	XWritePixmapFile function (otherwise this member should be set to
	NULL). This way colorname will be searched and written out if found
	instead of the RGB value,
	- Imakefile originally provided by stolcke@ICSI.Berkeley.EDU,
	- the old Makefile is now distributed as Makefile.noXtree and presents
	install targets,
	- the demo application is renamed sxpm (Show XPM), creates a window of
	the size of the pixmap if no geometry is specified, prints out
	messages instead of status when an error occurs, handles the new
	option -p for overriding colors by giving a pixel value (not really
	useful but is just here to show this new feature), handles the new
	option -rgb for specifying an rgb text file, and ends on
	keypress as buttonpress,
	- defines for SYSV have been provided by Paul Breslaw
	<paul@mecazh.uucp>,
	- the distribution includes a new directory called converters which
	contains xpm1to2 and xpm1to2c perl converters and a ppmtoxpm2
	converter provided by Paul Breslaw who upgraded the original ppmtoxpm
	written by Mark W. Snitily <mark@zok.uucp>.

    CHANGES TO THE DOC:
	- this file is created and will give old users a quick reference to
	changes made from one release to the next one,
	- documentation is changed to present the new ColorSymbol structure
	and the way to override colors by giving a pixel value, and to present
	the new XpmInfo structure and how to use it,
	- a man page for sxpm is added to the distrib,
	- the README file talks about sxpm and no more demo, and have
	reference to the different converters.

2.7		(90/11/12)

    NEW FEATURES:
	- XReadPixmapFile reads from stdin if filename is NULL,
	- XWritePixmapFile writes to stdin if filename is NULL,
	- the demo application handles the new option -nod for no displaying
	the pixmap in a window (useful when used as converter).

    CHANGES TO THE DOC:
	- documentation about the new feature.

2.6		(90/10/29)

    NEW FEATURES:
	- from nazgul@alphalpha.com (Kee Hinckley): changes to make the
	library usable as C++ code, and on Apollo without any warning.

    BUGS CORRECTED:
	- from nazgul@alphalpha.com (Kee Hinckley): the xpm include files was
	declaring XWritePixmapFile as taking in arg a Pixmap pointer instead
	of a Pixmap.

2.5		(90/10/17)

    BUGS CORRECTED:
	- XWritePixmapFile was not closing the file while ending normaly.

2.4		(90/09/06)

    NEW FEATURES:
	- XReadPixmapFile reads from a piped uncompress if the given filename
	ends by .Z or if filename.Z exists,
	- XWritePixmapFile writes to a piped compress if the given filename
	ends by .Z.

    BUGS CORRECTED:
	- demo now deals with window manager.

    CHANGES TO THE DOC:
	- documentation about compressed files management.

2.3		(90/08/30)

    BUGS CORRECTED:
	- handle monochrom display correctly,
	- comments can be empty.

2.2		(90/08/27)

    BUGS CORRECTED:
	- when reading some invalid free was dumping core on some machine.

2.1		(90/08/24)

    First distribution of XPM2.
