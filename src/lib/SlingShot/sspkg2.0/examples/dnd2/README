icon_dnd - SlingShot 2.0 drag-n-drop example
--------------------------------------------

This example shows how file manager objects (files) can be dragged and
dropped, between different deskset applikations. Files are represented
using file manager alike icons, defined using the Classing Engine (CE)
interface provided in cei.h/cei.c.

You should be able to drag a file from the file manager to icon_dnd
and then to another deskset tool.

Files included:

	README		..is what you are reading
	Makefile	
	cei.h		CE Interface header file.
	cei.c		CE interface implementation.
	icon_dnd.c	the icon drag-and-drop example
		
CAVEATS:

It only compiles and runs under OpenWindows 3.0.

Neither the Classing Engine (CE) interfec or the deskset drag and drop
interface provided in this file should be used for "real" applications. 
Those parts are provided just to demonstrate basic ideas (at least they
are not properlytested).

The code included are unsupported hackerware.
