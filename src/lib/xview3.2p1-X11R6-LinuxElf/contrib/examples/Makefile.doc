# Makefile for the code/programs subdirectory.
# INTERNAL USE ONLY!
# Used to generate the code examples included in the manual.
#	This grabs the program from the actual source SCCS directory,
#	then generates a "progname.cmod" file that can be
#	included in troff manuals using ".so progname.cmod".
#	To do this it:
#	  o	changes "\" to "\e"
#	  o	changes ^L to ".bp" -- only works if table is inside a
#		    .LS no
#		in troff.
#	  o	expands tabs
#
# Notes:
#   o	If you use .LS 4 in the manual, then the program will look different
#	in the manual -- tabs will come out closer together.
#   o	You have to have an SCCS link to the right place for the programs.
#	This means that the Makefile for making the troff version can't
#	come from that directory ??
#
# Ideas:
#	Have it count and warn how many lines are between ^L/.bp's
