Building with gcc
-----------------
This was tested on SunOS 4.1.2 and SunoS5.2.
The build on SunOS 5.2 does not work and we did not
have the cycles to investigate.

The SunOS 4.1.12 gcc libxview build was successful (with
many warnings). We first built with :

	HasGcc (site.def) set to YES,
	WantToCompileSharedLibs (XView.tmpl) set to YES.

This caused everything to be built with cc, except the clients. 
Everything was OK as far as we could tell.

Building with

	HasGcc (site.def) set to YES,
	WantToCompileSharedLibs (XView.tmpl) set to NO.

has more problems. The static libxview built with gcc(libxview.a)
without any errors (lots of warnings!).

Upon building the 'clients' directory, we get the following error:

gcc -fstrength-reduce -fpcc-struct-return -o olwmslave cmdstream.o  help_file.o  helprecv.o  helpwin.o  mem.o  olwmslave.o  propsrecv.o  propswin.o -O   -L/gaby3/R5_install/sun4-4.x/lib -L/baggio2/MIT_CONTRIB/XVIEW32/TEST_INSTALL/lib -lxview -L/baggio2/MIT_CONTRIB/XVIEW32/TEST_INSTALL/lib -lolgx -lXext -lX11    -B/usr/bin/
ld: Undefined symbol 
   _compile 
   _step 
*** Error code 1

This only occurs for XView clients (olwmslave, cmdtool, clock), so 
I assume it had to do with the libxview.a build. Once again, we 
did not have the time to look into this.
