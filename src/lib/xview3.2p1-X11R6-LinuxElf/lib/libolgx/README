What Is OLGX:
------------
The olgx (OpenLook Graphics for X11) library is currently used by olwm
(OpenLook Window Manager) and will be used by the XView library in
a future release.  Olgx is an X11 drawing engine for 2-D and 3-D objects
which is based upon xlib rather than a toolkit.  This needs to be built before
olwm can be built.

A document describing te olgx api can be found in the doc directory.
It is called olgx_api.{txt, ps}.

Future Directions for OLGX:
--------------------------
Although the content of the library may change in the future, the
API (Application Programmer's Interface) should remain stable.
