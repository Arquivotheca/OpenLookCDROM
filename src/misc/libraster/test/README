Test and timing suite for the raster library.


Here are a bunch of small programs to test out various aspects of
the raster library.


memcpy:  Check whether memcpy or a longword copy loop is faster on your
machine.

chars:  Displays all 95 printing characters in a grid, with
a cross on the 0,0 point so you can see whether both versions line up
the same way.

melt:  Based on the classic meltdown hack, moves squares randomly by
one pixel.  Tests whether overlapping blits work right.

nosrc: Randomly sets, clears, or inverts squares.  Tests the no-src blits.

overlap: Tests the code for self-overlapping blits.

rot:  Rotates random squares.  Tests some of the less common logical
operations.

scroll:  Does 100 full-screen simulated scrolls.

splines: Displays a bunch of splines, to test line-drawing.

squares: Displays a bunch of tiny squares at different x positions.  Useful
to check whether the edge cases are being handled correctly.

text:  Displays the 95 printing characters 500 times, so you
can compare timings.

ttext: Text transparent text.
