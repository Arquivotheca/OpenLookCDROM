      libraster - simple low-level raster graphics library
                       version of 12oct93

This is simple raster graphics package.  It's basically a redesigned
and reimplemented edition of Sun's old pixrect library.  It does
rectangle operations (bit-blits), points, lines, text (using vfont
files), stencils, tiling, image file i/o (using Sun rasterfiles), etc.

There is also a subsidiary library that provides an API very similar to
pixrect.  You can use this to keep your pixrect-based programs going
under Solaris 2.x, where Sun has decided to get rid of pixrect.

All system-dependent sections are in the file raster_sys.c, marked with
the string "SYS".  The main system-dependent part is getting the
address of the frame buffer.  It assumes a frame buffer either one bit
or eight bits deep, that can be byte-addressed but prefers to be
longword-addressed.  Currently it has been implemented on Suns, and it
should work on most combinations of Sun frame buffers and operating
systems.  If you port to a non-Sun system let me know, I'm very
interested!  It should be fairly straightforward.

To install:
    Unpack the files.
    Edit the Makefile, and follow the directions for configuring.
	(Note: the Makefiles in the subdirectories also have config stuff,
	but you don't have to bother with that.  Only do the top-level one,
	and it will pass the defines through to the rest.)
    Make.
    Make install, if you like.
