          screendump - screen dumping program for libraster
                       version of 09oct93

Screendump is a re-implementation of the standard Sun screendump program,
using the libraster bitblit package, with some minor changes.

  o Sun screendump uses single-character flags, with combinations
     permitted; this screendump uses multi-character flags, with
     abbreviations permitted.

  o Sun screendump uses the -e and -t type flags to specify the
    rasterfile type; this screendump uses -standard and -rle.

  o Sun screendump lets you specify an output filename in the args;
    this screendump always writes to standard output, and you can
    specify the filename with the usual shell redirection syntax.

See the manual entry for more details.
