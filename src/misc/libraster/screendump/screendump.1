.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I Screendump
is an almost upward-compatible replacement for Sun's old
.IR screendump .
It the contents of the screen and writes it out as a rasterfile.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -standard
Write the rasterfile in RT_STANDARD format.
This format is generally much larger than the default run-length-encoded
format, so you only want to use it when you are stuck with a rasterfile
reader that doesn't support run-length-encoding.
.TP
.B -rle
Write the rasterfile in RT_BYTE_ENCODED format.
This is the default, so unless you have modified the source it's a no-op.
.TP
.B -x
The x coordinate to start the dump.
.TP
.B -y
The y coordinate to start the dump.
.TP
.B -X
The width of the dump.
.TP
.B -Y
The height of the dump.
.TP
.B -fb
Use an alternate frame buffer.
The default is /dev/fb.
.LP
All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
