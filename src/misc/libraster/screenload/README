          screenload - screen loading program for libraster
                       version of 09oct93

Screenload is a re-implementation of the standard Sun screenload program,
using the libraster bitblit package, with some added features:

  o Sun screenload uses single-character flags, with combinations
    permitted; this screenload uses multi-character flags, with
    abbreviations permitted.

  o This screenload adds the -tile, -random, and -sleep flags.

  o This screenload will read and display multiple rasterfiles
    in sequence - this plus the -sleep flag lets you do simple
    animations.

  o Sun screenload's -g flag gives you the SunView gray pattern;
    this screenload's -gray flag gives you the X11 gray pattern.

  o In Sun screenload, the -h flag takes a hex count and a list
    of hex 16-bit patterns; in this screenload, the -hex flag
    takes a *decimal* count, plus the hex patterns.

See the manual entry for more details.
