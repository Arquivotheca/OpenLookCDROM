.LP
If there are remaining args (one is checked), it is the display device name.
For example, on a Sun3-110, you might want to use your greyscale screen,
not your monochrome screen.  So, you could specify:
.nf
    crumble -255 +254 /dev/fb
.fi
for color, or:
.nf
    crumble /dev/bwtwo0
.fi
for monochrome.
.LP
Obviously, you can't mix some of these arguments.  Trial and error
is the best way to figure out which don't work.
