.SH NAME
pixrect - reimplementation of Sun's pixrect library
.SH SYNOPSIS
ld ... -lpixrect -lraster
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
In Solaris 2.x, Sun left out a number of things.  Among them was
libpixrect, a low-level graphics library.  This is a replacement
for that library.
.LP
This package is actually a front-end that uses libraster to do all
the work.  Libraster is available separately.
.LP
Since this is provided for compatibility only, no documentation is
included.  It will let you keep old pixrect programs going.  For any
new development you should use libraster directly; or even better yet,
use X.
