         libpixrect - a clone of Sun's old pixrect library
                       version of 11oct93

In Solaris 2.x, Sun left out a number of things.  Among them was
libpixrect, a low-level graphics library.  This is a replacement
for that library.

This package is actually a front-end that uses libraster to do all
the work.  Libraster is available separately.

Supported features:
    basic pixrect (pr_open, pr_destroy, mem_create)
    basic bit-blit (pr_rop, pr_batchrop)
    colormaps (pr_getcolormap, pr_putcolormap)
    fonts (pf_open, pf_default, pf_close)
    text (pr_text, pr_ttext, pf_textbound, pf_textwidth)
    solid lines (pr_vector)
    points (pr_get, pr_put, pr_polypoint)
    subregions (pr_region)
    tiling (pr_replrop)
    stencils (pr_stencil)
    rasterfile read/write (pr_dump, pr_load)

Unsupported:
    textured lines (pr_line)
    bit planes, plane groups (pr_getattributes, pr_putattributes)
    polygons (pr_polygon_2)
