Test and timing suite for the pixrect library.


Here are a bunch of small programs to test out various aspects of
the pixrect library.


meltdown: Moves squares randomly by one pixel.  Tests whether
overlapping blits work right.

pchars: Displays all 95 printing characters in a grid, with
a cross on the 0,0 point so you can see whether both versions line up
the same way.

prot: Rotates random squares.  Tests some of the less common logical
operations.

pscroll: Does 100 full-screen simulated scrolls.

ptext: Displays the 95 printing characters 500 times, so you
can compare timings.
