OPEN LOOK and Motif Co-Existence.

Since both Motif and OPEN LOOK conform to the ICCCM, it is possible
to write Motif programs that work fully under OLWM, including OL Pins
on Motif programs. Ditto for OL programs under Motif Window Manager.

olmotif.c is a simple Motif demo program that sets certain Open
Look Window Manager (olwm) properties so that it can present a
OPEN LOOK "pinnable" main window when run under OLWM.
