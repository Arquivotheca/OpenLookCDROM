NFSTOOL

_______________

  Description
_______________

We have found from trade show experience that many people do not
comprehend NFS or the heterogeneous network environment it allows.

This demo is designed to simulate an NFS environment.

Partitions on a disk can be exported by one machine (simulating the 
/etc/exports list) by one machine and mounted by another. 
Using the demo is the equivalent of displaying the exported and/or mounted
file systems of 1 to 5 machines. 

_______________

  To run:
_______________

IMPORTANT: Clear the /tmp directory of nfstool related files.

	% rm /tmp/nfs*

Then open 1 to 5 tools, which may be server, sal or client. 

	% nfstool server &
	or
	% nfstool sal &          (standalone)
	or
	% nfstool client &

The border of each tool is in color. Each color represents a machine.
Emphasize the machine does NOT have to be a Sun, since NFS allows transparent
file access to other computers with other operating systems. 

You may have a "red", "green", "blue", "purple" or "orange"
machine, just as here at Sun Mountain View we have "sun", "demoserver",
"sunmark", "lyra", "servmark". 

Disk subwindow:
If you run  a server, the top subwindow has two
rectangles, representing a normal and an add-on disk. The normal
disk is divided into 3 partitions, root, usr, and usr2. 
The "xy0" and "xy1" represent disks controlled by a Xylogics controller.

If you run a sal or a client, the top subwindow has one disk.
Standalones have a SCSI controller, represented by "sd0".
Clients are network disk partitions, represented by "ndl0".

Tree subwindow:
The file system hierarchy on the machine is drawn as a tree structure
in the second subwindow. Each type of system draws a default file
system tree.

Mouse use:
_____________

Disk subwindow:
Depress and hold any button IN a partition. 
To export that partition to another machine, select the other machine's name.
To do anything useful with this exported partition, the other machine
has to be running. E.g. if you're red, and you export to blue,
have a blue window running. The checks are a visual indication of what
you have selected.
This is a toggle menu. To UNEXPORT a partition to a machine, choose 
the machine's name on the menu. The check will disappear.

Tree subwindow:
In this demo, you can mount an exported partition on a TERMINAL node of the 
tree ONLY. 
Depress the RIGHT mouse button over a TERMINAL node. The pop-up menu shows the
valid exports. E.g., if red has exported /usr
to blue, blue can mount /usr on any terminal node. This reduces
mass storage requirements and gives machines read-write access to immense 
amounts of disk space. The color of the mounted subtree reflects the color
of the machine exporting it. 
Depress the LEFT mouse button over any node to add or delete directories.
If you add or delete a directory to a MOUNTED subdirectory, the change is
reflected in the tree of the machine that is exporting that directory.

The ICON:
Is the latest Sun logo for NFS. This logo will be on stickers which
are on the handouts at Uniforum.
