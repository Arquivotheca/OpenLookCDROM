	Touchup is a public domain bitmap editor for Sun workstations
	that is very useful for "fixing" screen dumps and doing other
	types of bitmap editing.  Touchup is a powerful bitmap editor,
	a few of the capabilities are listed below:

		- paint with different textures
		- draw circles, rectangles, ovals, lines, and polygons
		- examine and modify a region at magnification 1-20
		- use text in many fonts
		- flood fill an area with a pattern
		- lasso a free form region within a bitmap
		- scale-stretch a region of a bitmap
		- rotate a region
		- move a region


How to install Touchup

1)  Unpack all of the archive files into the same directory.
    This should be the directory of final residence for the executable.
    Be sure to unpack archive 3 before archive 4 so that the proper
    directories are created.

2)  While in csh, type:

       printenv

    and be sure that the environment variable PWD appears and is set to
    the current directory; otherwise, you must modify the Makefile, defining
    PWD explicitly as the full path to the directory in which you have
    unpacked the files.

3)  Type the following command:

       % make

    On our local Sun 3/280 server, where we install the system in
    /usr/local/touchup, messages like the following are printed:

       The pattern directory is :/usr/local/touchup/pattern_icons
       The command directory is :/usr/local/touchup/command_icons

       if these are incorrect change the definitions in the Makefile
 
       touch info.image
       chmod 777 info.image
       uudecode temp_image
       /usr/maxwell/local/lib/touchup/strip_icon48x48
       Stripping circle_h.cicon...
       Stripping copy.cicon...

           ...

       Stripping pattern40.icon...
       Stripping brush1.icon...
       Stripping brush2.icon...
       Stripping brush3.icon...
       Stripping brush4.icon...
       Stripping brush5.icon...
       Stripping brush6.icon...


5)  Install the on-line manual page if desired:

       % cp touchup.man /usr/man/manl/touchup.l

6)  To clean up, you may remove all but the following files:

       touchup*
       info.image
       touchup.cat
       touchup_fonts

7)  To run touchup simply type:

       % touchup

NOTES:
    There is a standard man page in the file touchup.man
    or you can just press the "view" button on the upper
    left hand side of the control panel to display the man page.

    If you are using Touchup on a color Sun you may want to
    use the -n or -b option (you can read about these in the man page)
    so the it will run faster.

    Please read the file README_FONTS if you want more fonts in text mode.
