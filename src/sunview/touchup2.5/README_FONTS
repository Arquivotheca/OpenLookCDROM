  Once Touchup has been compiled an installed, users may add additional
  fonts to the font menu by creating a ".touchup" file in their
  home directory.


	1.) First copy the file "touchup_fonts" to ~/.touchup

		% cp /usr/local/touchup/touchup_fonts ~/.touchup

	2.) If you had five new fonts in the directory /usr/local/new_fonts
	    named font1, font2, font3, font4 and font5. You would edit the
 	    file ~/.touchup and add the following to the end of the file.

    
            /usr/local/new_fonts
	    "first font" font1. 8 10 12
	    "second font" font2. 10 12 14
	    "thrid font" font3. 10 12 16
	    "forth font" font4. 7 8 10
	    "fifth font" font5. 8 10 12

	    a) first give the directory in which the fonts can be found.
	    b) next give the name of the font, this name will be listed
		in the font menu
	    c) then give filename of the font
	    d) then list all of the point sizes of that fonts

	NOTE: Touchup gets the full path name to the font, by appending
		the font filename on to the directory name and then
		appending the point size on to that.


	Where can I get more fonts from ???

	The Sun User Group distributes tapes with public domain fonts
	in Sun vfont(5) format. These fonts can be used in Touchup.
	If you do not have access to these fonts you can send a
	e-mail request for fonts files to the address at the beginning
	of this file.
