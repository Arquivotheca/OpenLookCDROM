This program is a fractal generator.

To automate fractool,

type "fractool -f filename", preferably in a graphics tool. The specified
file consists of lines of the format

n pathname

where n is the desired number of interations, and pathname is the full
pathname of a file which was created with the "SAVE" button in 
non-automatic fractool.

The automatic mode will give n iterations of the specified fractal,
then implement the next line in the file, and so on. When it's done,
it goes back to the top of the file. It runs forever.
