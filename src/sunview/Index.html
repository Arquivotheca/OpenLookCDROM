<TITLE>SunView??</TITLE>
<H1>SunView??</H1>
<P>
SunView&TM; is, or was, Sun's first major widely-used window system.
It pre-dates The X Window System&tm; <I>by many years</I>.
So why is this stuff here?
The only reason is that (a) there is a semi-automatic <I>convert_to_xview</I>
script in the XView source directory, and (b) some of these programs
may be useful to somebody, someday.
Some brave soul may even succeed in converting them to XView fully
and getting them working - if you do please send them to us.
<P>
What's here is:
<UL><LI>Touchup, a very fancy bitmap tool (like xpaint)
<LI>fractool - a fractal viewing tool
<LI>moontool - show the phase of the moon
<LI><A HREF="mv_converted_to_xview">mv_converted_to_xview</A> - script to run after Sun's <I>convert_to_xview</I>
<LI>nfstool - NFS tool, displays NFS information
<LI>touchup2.5 - draw program, see Vol3OL Graphics Clients chapter.
</UL>
