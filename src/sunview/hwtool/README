Hi guys
The hwtool set has an environment var called HWHOME eg.
	setenv HWHOME /home/rockstar/tse/hardware
	to tell it where to look for the schedule and machines file.
The hwtool.sales has the schedule it, delete it, and annotate disabled so
	the sales people can look but not touch.

day.backup calls backup to copy schedule to schedule.<time stamp>
	to do the daily backup. I'll put an entry in crontab for it.

hwtool uses the serno of a machine to track it so there must be
	a name, serno, and description.
The Who for and Who Setup fields must be E-Mail addresses since schedule it, 
	delete it, and annotate it, all send E-mail to the respective parties.
	Usualy this is something like ron, fred or maybe server!john.
