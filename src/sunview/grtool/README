Removed the testsw - it was too expensive in terms of
winfds, results of regression and the output of Status
is now written to a file. See the -r option in the man page
and Section 9. (Defaults) in the documentation. The default file
is stdout.

The end is near...

Added driver for rasterfiles - specifically for the resolution
of an HP laserjet Series II

Linestyles are back in action - some weird problem with the
pre-defined line textures for pw_line(), fixed by defining my own.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Known problems:

1. Because of the number of windows used by grtool, there
   may not be enough left to run grtool. Close a few windows
   and try again, repeat as needed. (This is due to the use
   of a textsw, I've since discovered. By removing the textsw
   I was able to run two copies.)

2. Divide by zero, just don't (I'm working on this).
   I've inserted a matherr function, and I'm not
   sure how well it's working - seems to be okay.

-----------------------------------------------------------

There are 5 demos, run with

grtool test.dat -p test.par
grtool test2.dat -p test2.par
grtool test3.dat -p test3.par
grtool test4.dat -p test4.par
grtool errbar.dat -p errbar.par
grtool -p testc.par

The first two are just regular line/scatter graphs.
the third is a linear-log plot, the fourth is a plot
of the locations of part of the nonzero elements of a 
band matrix someone around here had. the fifth is a test
of error bars, and the last is a demo of
the special characters (ignore the warning messages).

Added error bars - max 7 sets with error bars.

Changed parameter file format - old parameter files can still
be read.

Added on-the-fly selection of fonts in strings. Also added the
capability to to sub/superscripting. Added special characters.
