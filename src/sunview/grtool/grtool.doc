Changing fonts within a string:

To change fonts within a string preceed the font number listed below by
a backslash. To turn subscripting or superscripting on or off use \s
for subscripts and \S for superscripting. Font selection is current for 
the remainder of the string or until the next font change. Subscripts
and superscripts remain for the remainder of the string or until \N
is seen. To print a backslash use \\. To backspace use \b. To
begin underlining use \u, to stop underlining use \U. \+ increases
the size of the characters and \- decreases the size of the characters.

Font #       Font

  0 ....  Complex Roman
  1 ....  Duplex Roman 
  2 ....  Simplex Roman 
  3 ....  Triplex Roman 
  4 ....  Complex Italic 
  5 ....  Triplex Italic 
  6 ....  Complex Script 
  7 ....  Simplex Script 
  8 ....  Complex Greek 
  9 ....  Simplex Greek 
  x ....  Special symbols 

Summary of other special commands

  + ....  increase size
  - ....  decrease size
  b ....  backspace length of previous character
  s ....  begin subscripting
  S ....  begin superscripting
  u ....  begin underline
  U ....  stop underline
  N ....  return to normal

  Example:

 \0F\sX\N(\9e\0) = sin(\9e\0)*e\S(-X)\N*cos(\9e\0)

                                  (-X)
  prints roughly  F (e) = sin(e)*e    *cos(e)
		   X

  using font 0 and e prints as epsilon from the Simplex Greek font.
  It is possible to do multiple subscripting and superscripting, like:

        x
       x
     10

  With backspacing you can do:

        x
       x
     10
       y
	y

   The string would look like 10\Sx\b\N\s\Ny\S\S\x\b\N\s\sy\N (yuk).

   NOTE:
   Special characters are mapped to the keyboard, the present mapping
   is not very well organized and may change. To see what they are
   use the demo 'grtool -p testc.par'. <space> maps to something 
   (epsilon I think).

1. 

SYNOPSIS
     grtool [data_files] [-h] [-r results_file] [-p parameter_file] 
	    [-d device_number]
 
DESCRIPTION
     Grtool is a data/function plotting program.
 
OPTIONS
     -r [results_file]
          Write the results of regression to results_file.

     -p [parm_file]
          Read the parameter file parm_file.
 
     -d [device]
          Set the hardcopy device to device.
 
     -h   Don't run interactive, just print a hardcopy  and  quit
          (used in batch mode).

     -f [output_file]
          When  the  selected  device  is  the  generic  graphics
          driver,  direct  output  to  file  output_file (used in
          batch mode).

2. The top row of buttons mark pulldown menus (use the right mouse button),
   except for the buttons marked 'Status' (information about sets),
   which is activated using the left mouse button.

   Note: The only menus in grtool are associated with buttons above the canvas.
   All buttons in popups use the left button (with the exception of cycles 
   which use both the right and left buttons for access).
         

3. Files (pulldown menu)

    Read data file (a blocking popup):

    There is a panel cycle indicating the type of data file:

        1. x,y on each line with sets separated by a non-digit character on a 
	   single line, multiple sets may be included by separating sets
	   by a line with non-numeric characters (say '&').

        2. x, y1, y2, y3, ..., on each line.

        3. pipe, data should be output in the format given above for 1, if 
	   this is not the case pipe the output through awk or some other 
	   filter, like myprog | awk '{print $3, $4}'

        4. IHL format - a format unique to our site.

        5. define the file name, in case of data or the command line in case 
	   of a pipe and with the left mouse button, click on the button marked 
	   'OK' or just press <return>. 

        6. in the top panel, with the left mouse button, click on the 'status' 
	   button to get information on the state of sets.

     Read parameter file (a blocking popup):

        1. Enter the parameter file name on the line labeled 'Parms file', 
	   press 'OK' or <return> to read a saved state of adjustable 
	   parameters, legends, strings, etc.

     Write parameter file (a blocking popup):

        1. Enter the parameter file name on the line labeled 'Parms file', 
	   press 'OK' or <return> to write the current state of adjustable 
	   parameters, legends, strings, etc.

4. Draw options (pulldown menu)


     Define world/view (a popup):


        Establishing the portion of the world coordinate system to be used

        1. Define the world coordinate system by filling in the necessary items
           Xmin, Xmax, Ymin, and Ymax. The plot will be drawn in world 
	   coordinates in a rectangle described by the two points (Xmin, Ymin),
	   (Xmax, Ymax).

        Note: make sure Xmin<Xmax and Ymin<Ymax.

        2. Press the button marked 'Define world' to inform grtool of the 
	   changes.

        3. The button marked 'Zoom' can be used to enlarge a portion of the
	   graph (viewport is unaffected). Press 'Zoom' with the left
	   mouse button, this will change the cursor type to a cross-hair.
	   Press the left mouse button at one corner of the region you
	   wish to zoom in on. A rectangle will show the current bounds of
	   the region that will be enlarged. Press the left mouse button
	   again when you are satisfied with the region.


        Establishing the viewport, or, where the graph will appear on the 
	graphics device.

        1. Define the viewport by filling in the necessary items Xmin, Xmax, 
	   Ymin, Ymax at the lines provided under the button 'Define view'. 
	   Viewport coordinates run from (0.0,0.0), the lower left corner of 
	   the screen, to (1.0,1.0), the upper right corner of the screen. The 
	   default view is (.2,.1), (.9,.9). 

        2. Press the button marked 'Define view' to make the change to the new 
           viewport.
 
        3. Press the 'Define view by mouse' button to use the mouse to define 
	   the viewport. Take the mouse to the lower left corner of the 
	   desired viewport and press the left button (there is no need to 
	   hold the button down).  A rubberband box will show you the 
	   current size of the viewport you may select. When you are satisfied 
	   with the view, press the left mouse button to activate the new 
	   viewport.

        There are four buttons marked Up, Down, Left, Right that will 
	allow you to page through the data. If you get lost, press Autoscale 
	to re-establish the default settings. The slider allows the amount
	to scroll to be set from 1% to 100% of the current world settings.

        'Update' will force grtool to read the state of the variables defined in
        the 'World' items and the 'View' items. The state of the plot parameters
        actually used can be different from those in the popup, due to the use 
	of zoom, or paging (re. the four buttons described above).

	'Autoscale method' is panel cycle used to set the style of autoscaling.
	The default is done by routines posted to the net by Paul Heckbert.
	This creates nice looking default graphs, but can make the results
	of zooming not cover the intended area. The second method, 'fixed
	scaling' allows the new world window to exactly match the zoomed area.
	'Autoscale' sets the default scaling and ticmark display.
	'Autoscale on set' sets the default scaling and ticmark display with
	respect to the set selected in the cycle to the immediate right.

	The panel cycle 'Auto re-draw' disables the re-drawing of the graph
	when operations are performed. This can save a lot of time re-drawing
	the graph when the sets are large. Press the 'Re-draw' button when
	you need a current view.


    Tics and labels (a non-blocking popup):

	Title and  subtitle are strings that appear centered at the top of the
	plot. X-axis label is centered at the bottom of the plot. Y-axis
	label is centered vertically to the left of the plot. Fill in
	the items indicated and press the button marked 'Define labels'.
	to draw the graph with the new definition of labeling information.
	To change the font used for labels, use the cycle marked 'Default
	font' and press 'Establish default font ...'.

        X-major/minor and Y-major/minor tics define the spacing of ticmarks on 
	the graph. Fill in the appropriate blanks and press 'Define tics' to 
	refresh the display. The units are positive deltas starting with
	the world minimums.
    
        'X-axis (Y-axis) labels format' determine the number of decimal places 
	to the right of the decimal point to display when drawing the tic 
	labels.

	'X-axis labels angle' takes on integer values representing the angle
	at which the tic labels are drawn. This can be used to prevent
	tic labels from running into each other when the number of X-axis
	tics is high.

        The tic toggles are self explanatory save for the items marked 'X-axis
        (Y-axis) logarithmic'. Turning these on (denoted by a check mark) 
	changes the meaning of the X-major (Y-major) and X-minor (Y-minor) 
	items at the top of this popup. X-major (Y-major) now denotes the 
	spacing of magnitudes and X-minor (Y-minor) tics determine the spacing 
	of interdecade marks (use integers only, 9 maximum).

	Another tic toggle item that needs explanation is 'X-axis tics 
	absolute' and the corresponding item for Y. These can be used to
	reverse the order of the graph by transforming X (Y) by 'x=-x' (y=-y).
	For instance, if you have a time series with time in years running
	from say 1900 to the present, by setting x = -x and using 'X-axis
	tics absolute', the data and the labels will look right (no minus
	signs on the labels).


    Symbols and legends (a popup):

	To define a symbol, color, and linestyle for a particular set:

	  1. Set the symbols, linestyle and pen (color) with the corresponding
	     panel cycle for each set desired.
	  2. Press the button 'Define symbols' with the left mouse button.

        To define the legend:

	  1. Define the legend in the text item marked 'Set n Legend', where
	     n is the number of the set legend to define.
	  2. Fill in the location of the legend in the items marked 'X' and
	     'Y'. Note: this location only needs to be set once as it defines
             where on the canvas the legend and all labels will be placed.
	  3. Use the panel cycle 'Legends' to toggle the display of legends.
	  4. Pressing the left mouse button on 'Define location with mouse'
	     is a convenient method of placing the legend on the canvas.
	     After pressing this button, move the mouse pointer to the desired
	     location and press again with the left button.
	  5. Press the button marked 'Define legend' when each entry is 
	     completed.
	  6. The items Lgap and Llen refer to the gap between legend items
	     and the length of the legend in units of characters (arbitrary).

	To define error bars on a set:

	  1. Load the set on which the error bars are to be placed.
	  2. Load the set with the values of the error bars. Y of the
	  error bar set will be used for the top, and X of the error
	  bar set will be used for the bottom. 
	  3. Using the cycle provided select the set with the error bars.
	  4. Then, select the set to which the error bars will be attached.
	  5. To register your selection, press the button marked 'Define
	  error bar'.
	  6. The comment line in 'Status' will remind you which set is which.

	  Note: The error bar will be drawn using the pen of the set to
	  which the error bars will be attached. It can be very confusing
	  to tell which set is attached to what - I'll try to come up
	  with something better.

     Press the button marked 'Done' to close the popup.


    Strings & Things (a popup):

	To define a text string to be drawn on the canvas:

	  1. There are 15 strings (this will change sometime in the
	     near future to a dynamic number). Select one with the panel
	     cycle, they are numbered from zero.
	  2. Select font, rotation (in integer degrees [-360,360]), size (double,
	     a multiplicative factor for scaling the character size, default
	     is 1.0 - use 1.5 for a character that is 1.5 times larger than
	     the default, etc.), location X, location Y, and then the string.
	  3. Using 'Define location with mouse' is a convenient method
	     of placing the string.  After pressing this button, move the 
	     mouse pointer to the desired location and press again with 
	     the left button.
	  4. Press the button marked 'Define' when each entry is 
	     completed.

	To define a line or box to be drawn on the canvas:

          Lines:

	  1. Select a pen and arrow if desired.
	  2. Press the button marked line.
	  3. Move the mouse locator to the point the line is to begin,
	     and press the left mouse button.
	  4. Move the mouse locator to the point the line is to end and
	     press the left mouse button.

          Boxes:

	  1. Select a pen.
	  2. Press the button marked box.
	  3. Move the mouse locator to one corner of the box and press 
	     the left mouse button.
	  4. Move the mouse locator to the point where the box is to end and
	     press the left mouse button again.

	To move a line or box:

	  1. Press the button marked 'Move', this should change the cursor to
	     the 'move' cursor.
          2. Press the left mouse button near the object to be moved.
	  3. Move the cursor to the new location and press the left mouse
	     button.

	To delete a line or box:

	  1. Press the button marked 'Delete', this should change the cursor to
	     a bullseye cursor.
          2. Press the left mouse button near the object to be deleted.

	  Note: The right mouse button cancels all operations (true throughout
	  grtool WRT mouse ops).

	  NOTE: lines and boxes scale with the plot, i.e. they are draw in 
	  world coordinates.


    Autoscale (action item):

	Releasing the right mouse button on this item will autoscale the
	plot.


    Zoom (action item):

           Release the right mouse button on 'Zoom', mark one corner of the 
	   with the left mouse button and track to the other corner and
	   press the left mouse button again.


    Flip X-Y (action item):

           Release the right mouse button on 'Flip X-Y' to swap the positions
	   of X and Y (all sets, tic marks, and labels will be swapped).


5. Compose (pulldown menu) - perform transformations and operations on sets

    1. Compose (a popup):

NOTE: Some of these operations generate new sets, if you run out of sets use 
Setops (described below) to kill unneeded sets. Also, the scaling of the world 
coordinate system may be inappropriate for the results for many of these
operations. Use the Status popup to determine the appropriate scaling factors 
to use in 'Define world' (above), or use 'Autoscale on set' (above).
Formula and load will operate on active sets only.

	There are presently 9 functions available in the compose popup:

	  o Formula, evaluates a formula in infix fashion.

		1. Select the set on which the formula will operate, (set must
		be active, use status to find the current state of sets).

		2. Enter the formula, the syntax is:

			(x,y,a,b,c,d)=<expression>

		where (x,y,a,b,c,d) are defined as the x and y of the currently
		selected set and a,b,c,d are scratch arrays that can be used
		to perform operations between sets. Case is not observed, so
		X=COS(X) is correct. The yacc grammar is listed below for 
		reference.

		3. Press the button 'Evaluate formula' with the left mouse
		button when you are satisfied with everything or press return
		with the caret in the text marked Formula.

	Examples: y=-y  /* negate y */
	          y=x*cos(2*x*PI/100)+sqr(x)
		  x=(index>10)*(x-5)+(index<=10)*x /* if the index of the current 
						      point is greater than 10 then
						      x=x-5 else x=x. */
		  a=y /* store y of the current set into scratch array 'a'
			 you may now select another set and perform the operation
			 y=somefunctionof(a) */

	o Load, load a sequence to (x,y) or (a,b,c,d).

		1. Select the set you wish to use (or all).
		2. Select the element of the set (x,y or a,b,c,d) to load.
		3. Enter the load start and step items.
		4. Press the button marked 'Load' to perform the action.

	o Histo, compute a frequency histogram.

		1. Select the set.
		2. Enter the width of a bin (all bin widths are the same).
		3. Enter the minimum and maximum values of the portion of
		the data you wish histoed.  Xmin and Xmax refer to the 
		RANGE of the set, not the domain.
		4. Press the button marked 'Histo' to compute the histogram.

	o DFT, FFT - compute the fourier spectrum.

		1. Select the set.
		2. Press DFT (for small data sets whose length is not a 
		power of 2) or FFT (for data sets whose length is a power of
		2). The FFT assumes complex data, if you wish to transform
		real data, make sure it is in X and Y=0. The DFT-by-definition
		assumes real data, evenly spaced, X is ignored. This function
		computes the periodogram only (this may change). 

		NOTE: Small is < 1000 points. The DFT is O(N**2).

	o Running average - compute a running mean.

		1. Select the set.
		2. Set the length of the running average in the text item
		marked 'Length of running average', must be less than the
		set length.
		3. Press the button marked 'Running avg.'.

	o Regression - perform linear or polynomial regression.

		1. Select the set.
		2. Select the degree of fit.
		4. Select fitted curve or residuals to load.
		5. Press the button marked 'Regress'.
		6. A set is loaded (if there is one) with the resulting curve,
		results are written to the status window.

	o Differentiation - numerical differentiation.

		1. Select the set.
		2. Select the method - one of forward, backward, or centered 
		difference. Assumes unevenly spaced data, increasing in X.
		3. Press the button marked 'Differentiate'.
		4. A set is loaded (if there is one) with the resulting curve.

	o Integration - numerical integration.

		1. Select the set.
		2. Select the form of the results, the item marked 'cumulative
		sum' will construct a set composed of the current value of
		the integral at a given X. Sum only reports just the value
		on the next line.  Assumes unevenly spaced data, increasing 
		in X.
		3. Press the button marked 'Integrate'.
		4. A set is loaded (if there is one) with the resulting curve if
		   'cumulative sum' is chosen.

	o X-corr - cross/auto-correlation

		1. Select both sets (use the same set if autocorrelation
		is desired).
		2. Select the lag, N/10 as a reasonable value.
		3. Select bias - generally this will not make any difference
		for large data sets with lags << the length of the set, I was 
		just curious. The difference is division by N (biased) or 
		N-lag (unbiased).
		4. A set is loaded (if there is one) with the resulting curve.

	Press 'Done' to close the compose popup.


     2. Setops (a popup) - perform operations on sets

	Setops allows sets to be created, destroyed, written to disk, sorted.

	o Activate - make a set active and able to participate in operations.

		1. Select the set to activate.
		2. Press the button marked 'Activate'.

	o Set length - set the length of a set.

		1. Select the set.
		2. Fill in the item marked Length.
		3. Press the button marked 'Set length'.

		
	NOTE:  The previous 2 operations allow the creation of sets and through
	the use of the Compose functions, Formula and Load, fill these sets
	in a meaningful way. Remember when you activate a set to also set
	the length (this should be just one operation).

	o Copy - copy one set to another.

		1. Select the set to copy from.
		2. Select the set to copy to.
		3. Press the button marked 'Copy'.
		
	NOTE: Both sets must be active, although this seems that it should
	be unnecessary to have the 'to' set active.

	o Drop - drop points from a set.

		1. Select the set.
		2. Fill in the items 'Start drop' and 'End drop'.
		3. Press the button marked 'Drop'.

	NOTE: Elements in a set are numbered from 1 to N, where N is the
	number of elements in the set (as opposed to sets which are numbered
	from 0).

	o Join - merge 2 sets together.

		1. Select the set to add to the set selected in the
		item to the immediate right.
		2. Press the button marked 'Join' to append the first set to
		the second.

	o Kill - eliminate a set.

		1. Select the set to kill.
		2. Press the button 'Kill'.

	NOTE: This operation is final.

	o Flush all active sets - kill the active sets.

		1. Press the button marked 'Flush all active sets' to perform
		a kill on each active set.

	o Sort - sort x or y of a set.

		1. Select set to sort.
		2. Select which component (x or y) as a key.
		3. Select the order of the sort.
		4. Press the button marked 'Sort' to perform the action.

	o Write - Write a set to disk.

		1. Select the set to write or 'All'.
		2. Fill in the format to use to write, syntax is C, default is
		'%lf %lf'.
		3. Fill in the item marked 'Write to file' with the filename
		to write.
		4. Press the button marked 'Write'.


	Press the button marked 'Done' to close the popup.


     2. Edit points (a popup) - perform operations on points within sets.

	o Find point - report on a point in a set

		1. Press 'Find point' with the left mouse button to activate.
		2. Position the pointer close to the data point to identify.
		3. Press the left mouse button. 
		4. The set, the location in the set, and (X, Y) for the datum 
		nearest to the pointer will be displayed in the text item 
		immediately below.
		5. Press the right mouse button to shut off the 'Find point'
		feature.

	o Delete point 

		1. Press 'Delete point' with the left mouse button to activate.
		2. Position the pointer close to the data point to identify.
		3. Press the left mouse button. 

	o Clip points to window

		1. Press 'Clip points to window' to delete all points from all
		sets that lie outside the current window.

	o Clip points in window

		1. Press 'Clip points in window' to delete all points from all
		sets that lie inside the current window.

	Press the button marked 'Done' to close the popup.


6. Re-draw - an action item activated by the left mouse button.

	Re-draw redraws the canvas with the current set of draw parameters and
	active sets. Some operations do not perform an automatic re-draw, 
	notably operations using the Compose and Setops functions. If you
	feel something should have happened press this button to force a
	draw operation. Grtool does not automatically re-draw after a resize
	event so you will need to to a re-draw in this instance also.

7. Hardcopy - an action item activated by the left mouse button. 

	Pressing this button sends the current plot to the hardcopy device
	selected in the item 'Devices' located to the immediate right.

8. Devices (pulldown menu) - select the current hardcopy device.

	Press the right mouse button to get a list of hard copy devices.
	Release the mouse button to select a particular device.

	NOTE: This item needs to be changed to a panel cycle as there is
	no way of knowing for sure which device is the current one. The
	default is presently a 7550 HP plotter 8.5x11 in landscape mode.

	
9. Status (popup) - show the status of sets, min, max, mean, and 
	standard deviation (sample standard deviation).

	Press the button marked 'Status' with the left mouse button
	to display.

	
10. Defaults (popup) - set program defaults, presently just the file to
    write the results of regression and the output of Status.

11. Done (action item) - Press the 'Done' button with the left mouse button
	to exit grtool.

	Note: As of this writing, 'Done' is a no turnback exit.
