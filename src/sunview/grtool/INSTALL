This was developed on a Sun 4/260 with 1680x1200 mono monitor 
running SunOS 4.0, it is known to run on 3/60s and 386i's.

You'll need to set the following defines in defines.h to something
smaller for lower resolution screens.

1:

Presently set at (close to landscape size on our screen):

#define WINDOWW 1261	/* window dimensions */
#define WINDOWH 1047
#define TWINDOWW 600	/* size of textsw */
#define TWINDOWH 500

try

#define WINDOWW 950	/* window dimensions - for lower res */
#define WINDOWH 700	/* screens */

2:

There is a variable in sunview.c -

double sviewcharsize = 0.8;

If you have a lower res screen change this to 0.7 so characters on
the screen will more closely match the hardcopy output.

3:

Set MAXARR in defines.h for what you think will be a reasonable size for
sets at your site.

#define MAXARR 2048		/* max elements in an array */

4:

In case I forgot, check to make sure LOCAL (in defines.h) is not defined as
you will get code that is specific for our site if it is defined.

5:

Set HDEV in defines.h to the default hardcopy device

/*  1 = HP 7550 8.5x11 landscape */
/*  2 = HP 7550 8.5x11 portrait */
/*  3 = HP 7550 11x17 landscape */
/*  4 = HP 7550 11x17 portrait */
/*  5 = Generic */
/*  6 = PostScript landscape */
/*  7 = PostScript portrait */
/*  8 = HPGL cartridge in LaserJet II landscape */
/*  9 = HPGL cartridge in LaserJet II portrait */
#define HDEV 1			/* default hardcopy device */
				/* for our site a 7550 in landscape mode */

6:

The drivers are configured for our site, naturally,
you need to look at hp.c and ps.c for the lines that spool to lpr
or write to a file (the PostScript driver does this).
