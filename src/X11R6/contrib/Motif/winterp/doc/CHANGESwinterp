Most of the changes bet. WINTERP 1.13 (X11r5) and WINTERP 2.0 (X11r6) are
caused by changes from XLISP 2.1 to XLISP-PLUS 2.1c.

(1) OPEN primitive -- in <=1.13, would return NIL if it could not open a
file for reading or writing. In 1.14, it will signal an error unless
':if-does-not-exist NIL' arguments are added to all (open ... :direction
:input) calls. For errors on opening a file for write, one must enclose the
open call in an errset in order to have it behave like it did in older
versions of WINTERP. This is a change mandated by XLISP 2.1c and makes
winterp/xlisp mor compatible with Common Lisp.

(2) POPEN primitive -- no longer accepts arbitrarty arguments (which was a
bug in winterp <= 1.13). For example, some of the examples programs had
(open "ls" "r"), where the "r" was ignored. With winterp 1.14, the above
popen call would signal an error.

(3) If *breakenable* is set to T, the xlisp breakloop will be entered.
Unlike WINTERP versions <= 1.13, 1.14's breakloop is not even driven and
wil not process X events. The upshot of this is that people that
accidentally had *breakenable*==T will find their application's GUI
freezing upon an error because WINTERP has entered the breakloop. To fix
this, ^D into Winterp's stdin to exit the breakloop, or make sure that
*breakenable*==NIL when you are running your application.

(4) XLISP 2.1 had an implicit &allow-other-keys in all lambdas. This meant
that extra keywords in function calls, method invocations (etc) were
ignored. Xlisp 2.1c's increased common-lisp compatibility means that extra
keywords will signal an error unless the lambda,defun,:answer,etc specifies
&allow-other-keys.

(5) SYSTEM: new return values -- returns exit code, rather than 2, 512, 1024...

(6) In Winterp-Lisp, replace all (STRCAT ...) with (CONCATENATE 'STRING ...)

(7) The addition of new WINTERP applicationr resources
		Winterp.lispLoadPath
		Winterp.enableXtErrorBreak: true
		Winterp.enableXtWarningBreak: false
		Winterp.enableXErrorBreak: true
		Winterp.enableInitMsgs: true
