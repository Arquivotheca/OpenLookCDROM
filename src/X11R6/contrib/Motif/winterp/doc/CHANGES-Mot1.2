==============================================================================
For XM_ROW_COLUMN_WIDGET_CLASS, resource :XMN_PACKING should not be
set to :NO_PACKING, as this will result in a warning

| error: X Toolkit Warning:
|     
|     Name: rc
|     Class: XmRowColumn
|     illegal value (0) for rep type XmRPacking

Motif 1.0 and 1.1 automatically converted :NO_PACKING to whatever default
kind of packing apllied to the specific kind of row/col widget. Typically
this is :PACK_NONE, but it might also be :PACK_COLUMN.

==============================================================================

Shouldn't add the following txlation to list widget

	    :XMN_TRANSLATIONS	"#override                          \
		<Btn2Down>:   	ListBeginSelect()                   \
		<Btn2Up>:	ListEndSelect() ListKbdActivate()   \
	    ...

Since Motif 1.2 binds the drag operation to Button2-down...

==============================================================================

If one must add translations to a list widget, should heed the following
warning from modem-dialer.lsp, grep-br.lsp, dircmp.lsp

	;;
	;; In Motif 1.2, doing
	;;       (send <w> :SET_VALUES :XMN_TRANSLATIONS "#override...")
	;; has additional problem of completely deleting the original
	;; translation table, therefore, we use
	;;       (send <w> :OVERRIDE_TRANSLATIONS "...")
	;; form below -- this works properly for both Motif 1.1 and 1.2.
	;;
	(send-super :OVERRIDE_TRANSLATIONS
		    "   <Btn2Down>:   	ListBeginSelect() \
			<Btn2Up>:	ListEndSelect() ListKbdActivate() \
			Ctrl<Key>N:	Lisp(send ACTION_WIDGET :goto_next) \
			<Key>N:		Lisp(send ACTION_WIDGET :goto_next) \
			<Key>osfDown:	Lisp(send ACTION_WIDGET :goto_next) \
