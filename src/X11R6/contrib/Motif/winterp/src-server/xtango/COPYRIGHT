* AVAILABILITY:

*		the version of 'libexpect' used in WINTERP is older than
*		the versions available via FTP. Since most of the changes
*		to 'expect' were done to the TCL-based 'expect' application
*		which has little to do with the expect library; also the
*		current 'libexpect' seems sufficient, so no update necessary.
