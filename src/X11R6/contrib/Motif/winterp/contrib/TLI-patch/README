Subject: Mods to winterp 1.11 for TLI and Sequent DYNIX/ptx
Date: Wed, 01 May 91 16:23:04 -0700


Following is a uuencoded, compressed tar file containing the files I
modified to port winterp 1.11 to Sequent's DYNIX/ptx 1.2.0 using TLI
for the comm stuff. I think this will run on any sysV-ish TLI without
modifications. You should also be able to mix and match TLI clients
with BSD servers and visa-versa (though I haven't tryed this).
