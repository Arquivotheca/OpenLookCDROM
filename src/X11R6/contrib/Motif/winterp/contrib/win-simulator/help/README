These help files are called up by the code in ../lisp/help.lsp.

some things to note:

(1) the help file on a particular widget has the same name as
    given to a widget.
	(i) If you change the name of a widget, you'll have to change
            the name of the help file.
	(ii) two or more widgets shouldn't have the same name unless you
             want  the same help file to be displayed for those widgets.
	     (this is true even if two or more same-named widgets are
	      in a completely different widget hierarchy.)
