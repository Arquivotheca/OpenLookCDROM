# by setting -class WSimulator, WINTERP will look up various resource
# settings for the simulator application in file
#	 /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/WSimulator
# it is essential that 
# /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/WSimulator is the same as file 
# /usr/local/win-simulator/WSimulator.ad
#
# i.e., as root, do
# 'ln -s /usr/local/win-simulator//WSimulator.ad /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/WSimulator'
