To install this, you must
(0) have installed this distribution on /usr/local/win-simulator/
(1) have a winterp binary somewhere on your $PATH
(2) 'ln -s /usr/local/win-simulator/WSimulator.ad /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/WSimulator'
(3) 'ln -s /usr/local/win-simulator/bin/win-simulator /usr/local/bin/win-simulator
(4) rehash (if running csh) then execute 'win-simulator'

The file lisp/API.lsp contains most of the external programmatic interfaces to the simulator.
The file lisp/test.lsp shows how the methods in API.lsp can be used to programmatically
alter the UI...

Note that I haven't done the following:
	(1) predicate registers
	(2) floating registers

I want to find out whether my treatment of integer registers is ok before I go on to do
the other kinds of registers. Those two displays will essentially be slightly mutated
copies of the integer register that I've implemented.
