How to install and run the Xmu menu server:

(1) Copy Xmu.ad to /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Xmu

(2) edit /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Xmu
  Unless you've installed the winterp distribution under
  /usr/local/winterp, you will need to change the 
  "/usr/local/winterp" strings below to the location of your
  winterp installation.
	Xmu.lispInitFile: /usr/local/winterp/contrib/xmu/xmu-init.lsp
	Xmu.lispLibDir:   /usr/local/winterp/contrib/xmu/

  Also, you may want to set the location of the xmu server socket to
  somewhere other than /tmp if you are on a multiuser machine.
	Xmu.unixSocketFilepath:		/tmp/.xmu_server
  Note that if you change Xmu.unixSocketFilepath, you'll also have to
  change "SERVER=/tmp/.xmu_server" in the scripts
  winterp/contrib/xmu/bin/xmu, winterp/contrib/xmu/bin/xmu_server, and
  winterp/contrib/xmu/bin/xmu_nuke

(3) run the shell script bin/xmu_server
	(the first time you do this, uniconize the icon entitled
	"XmuServer" to see if any error messages are produced. The
	"XmuServer" window is an xterm which displays the output
	from WINTERP's XLISP server.)

(4) start up gnu-emacs or gnuvo(HP only).

(5) In gnuemacs or gnuvo, load the following files, with the appropriate
path substituted for "~/src/widgit/". Typically, you can just put these
files in the *scratch* buffer, put the cursor on the opening paren of each
form, and do C-M-X to evaluate the form. Alternately, you may use M-X
load-file to interactively load the desired files. Finally, you could just
put these files into your ~/.emacs...

	(load "~/src/widgit/contrib/xmu/GNU/xmu-menu")
	(load "~/src/widgit/contrib/xmu/GNU/xmu-demo")
	(load "~/src/widgit/contrib/xmu/GNU/xmenu-lib")
	(load "~/src/widgit/contrib/xmu/GNU/xmenu-demo")

(6) Now you're ready to try some demos:

Now, do M-x xmu-demo, and a menu should pop up. Upon selecting a menu item
(using mouse button 3), the picked item should be printed out in gnuemacs'
minibuffer.

Also, try M-X xmenu-buffer-select, which will pop up a menu with all the
buffers you've previously visited in your gnuemacs editing session. Select
a buffer name with mouse button 3 and that buffer will pop up in gnuemacs.

In order to override the standard gnuemacs buffer selection keybinding,
you may use:
	(define-key global-map "\^x\^b" 'xmenu-buffer-select)
