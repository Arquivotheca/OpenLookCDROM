Toolkit:	OSF/Motif, WINTERP (Widget INTERPreter), 
		David Harrison's Table Widget.

Toolkit version: Motif==1.1.4, WINTERP==1.14.
		(Note that WINTERP 1.14 has not yet been released. However,
		all of the code for this "assignment" will work with the
		current release of WINTERP (1.13, on X11r5 contrib tape)
		except for the code using the Table widget. The table widget
		was added for WINTERP 1.14.)

==============================================================================
		Time			Lines of code 
					(includes some comments, excludes
					 block comments and most whitespace).
==============================================================================
Phase0		35			139

Phase1		10 (20)			285
					(note that it took additional 20 mins
					to restructure code from Phase0 in an
					object oriented fashion in order to:
					(i) eliminate all global variables
					(ii) make code easier to modify for
					upcoming phases. This also probably
					added 50% more lines but reduced
					incremental time and L.O.C. for later
					phases.)

Phase2		7			++ 25 (310 total)

Phase3		14			++ 46 (356 total)

Phase4		26 (20 for hacking	++ 40 (396 total)
		    difficulty of adding
                    accels to Motif buttons)

Phase5		40			++ 79 (475 total)
					(time to implement simple context 
					 sensitive help system)
		12			++ 42 (517 total)
					(time to implement using help system
					 above, doesn't include size of help files)

Phase6		N/A			N/A
