I sent this out a couple of weeks ago and got little response.  The results
of this little test may end up as the subject for a magazine article or
paper so if you have a couple of hours please participate, your toolkit will
thank you for it :-)

So far I have results for the following toolkits:

Motif with C++				(Doug Young)
Motif with WCL				(David Lewis)
OLIT with WCL and Dirt			(Tim Panton)
InterViews with a proprietary UIMS	(Jean-Claude Dulac)
OI and uib				(Warner Losh)

It would be useful to get vanilla XView, OLIT, Motif, and InterViews
versions.  So I don't get swamped (yeah right :-) we'll set the ending
date for submissions to be March 31, 1992.

Here's the text of the original message:
-------------------------------------------------------------
Anyone up for a challenge?

We have just finished updating our OI tutorial to go over the
development of a real application touching on many aspects of the
toolkit.  What I thought would be interesting is if we took the same
sample application and developed it in OLIT, Motif, XView, Athena,
InterViews, Neuron Data, Visix Galaxy, etc., and then compare the
results.  The reason I would like other people to get involved is
because we do not have the expertise in the other toolkits to do them
justice.

The application you will need to write is a simple rolodex program.  It
will basically consist of a main window, a main menu with a pulldown, a
couple of dialog boxes, some single line text entry fields, and some
buttons.  Rather than spending a lot of time writing the file
manipulation backend, callbacks should simple spit their results to
stderr or stdout.

The final phase of the application will involve throwing away all the
front end user interface code you developed in the previous phases and
redo the GUI portion with the user interface builder of your choice.
If you don't use or have access to a builder I would still be
interested in your numbers for the first phases.  If you only want to
do it with the builder, feel free to do that as well and send me the
results.

The application should be well behaved.  If fonts or labels change due
to resource fetching cause the size of objects to change, they should
adjust their positions accordingly.  If possible, align the labels as
shown in the slides.  The Help pulldown should actually do something as
will pressing the Help key over individual objects.  I should be able
to plug in a database backend and be able to use your program.

We did not write this application to show off any particular feature of
the OI toolkit, it's a reasonable application that any toolkit should
be able to implement.

I have placed shar files on the following machines that include
overhead slides of screen dumps of what the finished application looks
like using the OI toolkit.

solbourne.solbourne.com		~ftp/pub/uploads/from.toml/challenge.tar.Z

I'm not sure what if anything we will find out from this test.  The
time to develop the application is probably the most important,
different coding styles could make the number of lines of code
meaningless.

Please fill out the following form and email it back to me if/when you
complete the challenge.  If possible, I would very much like to see
your code also.
