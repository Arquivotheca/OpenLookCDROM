tree-whier.lsp:

DONE>> (1) Doesn't display menu items, just cascade buttons. Need to explicitly
DONE>> check for cascade button widget/gadgets. If we have one, then :get_values
DONE>> :xmn_sub_menu_id and do :get_children on that...
DONE>> (setq w (get_moused_widget))
DONE>> --> #<widget XM_CASCADE_BUTTON_GADGET_CLASS: #1ec40e>
DONE>> (send (car (send w :get_values :xmn_sub_menu_id nil)) :get_children)

(2) Doesn't display popup items either. WIll need to add a primitive similar
to :get_children which retrieves the popups from a widget...

==============================================================================
THINGS I WISH SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD DO AND CONTRIBUTE.
===================================================

* an emacs clone (bindings-wise) using the XmText widget!!

* emacs-like incremental search bindings on XmList widget. Also normal
search and sort bindings to XmList widget.
