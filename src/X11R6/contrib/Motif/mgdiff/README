This is mgdiff, a graphical front end to the Unix diff command based
upon X11R[456] and the Motif widget set.  It allows the user to select
two files for comparison, runs the diff command, parses the output and
presents the results graphically.  This presentation can also be used
to generate a user-specified merge of the two files into a third file.

This program's appearance is based upon a program called gdiff, which
runs only on Silicon Graphics workstations and for which source code
is not provided.

The program has been developed and tested in the following
environment:

	- Dell SVR4 Issue 2.2 
	- cc and gcc 2.3.3
	- X11R4 and X11R5
	- Motif 1.1.4

It has received some testing using SGI IRIX 5.2 with cc, X11R5 and
Motif 1.2.3.

It should build fairly painlessly with the Imakefile provided.  You
may need to point the Imakefile at your Motif libraries.

You will need to install the application defaults file correctly for
the program to run at all.

An XPM icon file is provided if your window manager can use it.

A preformatted manual page is also provided for those who don't have
DWB or it's equivalent.

Please send your comments, bug reports, bug fixes etc. to:

Enjoy,
Dan
