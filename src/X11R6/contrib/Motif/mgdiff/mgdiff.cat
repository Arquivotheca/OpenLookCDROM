       _M_g_d_i_f_f is a graphical front end to the _d_i_f_f command.  It
       permits the user to view the differences between two ASCII
       files in context and, optionally, to write out a third
       file which is the user-defined merging of those two files.
       It is inspired by a similar program, called _g_d_i_f_f_, which
       runs only on Silicon Graphics workstations and for which
       source code is not provided.

       The program takes as arguments various flags (described in
       the next section) and the names of two files to compare.
       Either filename (but not both) may be given as '-' to use
       standard input instead.

       The resulting display consists mostly of two panes of
       text; the one on the left is the first file specified and
       the one on the right is the second file specified.
       Between and below the text panes are scrollbars that per-
       mit changing the visible portions of the two files being
       compared.  In addition, the program implements the
       Scrolled Region recommendations of Section 2.3.4 of the
       OSF/Motif Style Guide (release 1.1), meaning that the
       arrow and paging keys will work to scroll as well.  Above
       each text pane is the name of the file in that text pane
       and the line number in the file which is being displayed.

       The text in each of the text panes is divided into blocks
       of lines which are color-coded with one of five different
       colors.  This indicates that the block:

              differs between the two files

              is identical between the two files

              has been inserted in one file or the other

              is for display purposes (to match an inserted block
              in the other file)

              has been selected by the user (for writing to a
              merged file)

       These colors can be modified by the user via X resources;
       see the RESOURCES section of this manual page.  A legend
       display of the colors and their meanings is available
       using the Help menu.




                                                                1

       On the right-hand side of the display is an overview area;
       this shows the files in their entirety.  The sliders in
       the overview area track the lines being displayed in the
       text panes.

       At the top of the display is a Motif menu bar; those func-
       tions are discussed in the MENUS section of this manual
       page.


CCOOMMMMAANNDD LLIINNEE OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --ttoooollkkiittooppttiioonn
               These are the standard options accepted by all
               applications that use the X Toolkit Intrinsics.
               See the OPTIONS section in the XX(1) manual page.

       --qquuiitt   This option sets the resource _M_g_d_i_f_f_._q_u_i_t_I_f_S_a_m_e to
               "true".  This will cause the program to exit imme-
               diately without bringing up a window if the two
               files have no differences (as determined by the
               _d_i_f_f command).

       --aarrggss _d_i_f_f_a_r_g_s
               This option sets the resource _M_g_d_i_f_f_._d_i_f_f_A_r_g_s to
               the value of the _d_i_f_f_a_r_g_s argument.  These flags
               are passed to the _d_i_f_f command that actually com-
               putes the differences between the two files.
               Since any argument can be passed, it is possible
               to specify flags that cause the _d_i_f_f command to
               fail or to generate output in a different format
               that will cause _m_g_d_i_f_f to fail.  For most versions
               of _d_i_f_f_, only three flags make any sense.  The
               first is '-b'; this causes _d_i_f_f to ignore trailing
               blanks (spaces and tabs) and to treat all other
               strings of blanks as equivalent.  The second flag
               is '-w'; this ignores blanks and treats strings of
               blanks as equivalent.  The last flag is '-i'; this
               ignores case when comparing letters.

       --ffiillee _n_a_m_e
               This command sets the resource _M_g_d_i_f_f_._f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e to
               the value of the _n_a_m_e argument.  _m_g_d_i_f_f uses this
               string to display over a file read from standard
               input.

              Brings up the "Open File" FileSelectionDialog to
              allow the user to specify a file to open and com-
              pare with the already opened right-hand file.

              OOppeenn RRiigghhtt......                 CCttrrll++RR

              Brings up the "Save File" FileSelectionDialog to
              allow the user to specify an output file for writ-
              ing the merged file; this is an application modal
              dialog.  The program will allow the user to over-
              write an existing file but pops up a QuestionDialog
              to allow the user to cancel the operation if
              desired.  If there are any unselected areas of dif-
              ference between the two files the user is notified
              via an ErrorDialog and the save operation is can-
              celed.

              EExxiitt                          CCttrrll++CC

              Exits the program immediately.

              Scrolls both file views so that the next unselected
              area of difference is _M_g_d_i_f_f_._l_i_n_e_s_O_f_C_o_n_t_e_x_t lines
              from the top of the application window.


       SSeelleecctt

       The two files being compared can be optionally merged into
       one file.  To do this, the user must select for each area
       of difference between the two files which version should
       be written to the merged file.  The menu entries in this
       pulldown menu allow the user to select or unselect differ-
       ences in groups rather than individually.

              LLeefftt AAllll

              For all areas of difference between the two files
              select the left-hand file version.

              RRiigghhtt AAllll

              For all areas of difference between the two files
              select the right-hand file version.

              UUnnsseelleecctt AAllll

              Unselects all areas of difference in both files.

              This menu entry toggles the presence of the
              overview area on the right-hand side of the appli-
              cation window.  The default value for this toggle
              is controlled by a resource, _M_g_d_i_f_f_._o_v_e_r_v_i_e_w, which
              is described in the RESOURCES section.

              zontal scrollbar at the bottom of the application
              window.  The default value for this toggle is con-
              trolled by a resource, _M_g_d_i_f_f_._h_o_r_z_S_c_r_o_l_l_b_a_r, which

              This menu entry toggles the behaviour of the
              scrollbars in the application window.  When set,
              dragging the slider of a scrollbar results in a
              immediate change in the view of the text being com-
              pared.  When unset, the view is only changed at the
              end of a slider drag (when the mouse button is
              released.)  This setting might be preferred on a
              slower X server.  The default value for this toggle
              is controlled by a resource, _M_g_d_i_f_f_._d_r_a_g_S_c_r_o_l_l,
              which is described in the RESOURCES section.


       HHeellpp

       This pulldown menu displays commands for obtaining help on
       or information about _m_g_d_i_f_f.

              Brings up a DialogShell with a ScrolledText widget
              containing this manual page.  The command for gen-
              erating this is customizable via a resource,
              _M_g_d_i_f_f_._m_a_n_C_o_m_m_a_n_d, which is described in the

              Brings up a DialogShell which summarizes the use of
              color in encoding the types of differences between
              the two files being compared.

       You can move directly to a particular spot in the two
       files by using BBDDrraagg in the overview area.

       The program uses what the OSF/Motif Style Guide calls
       "multiple selection" to select individual blocks for writ-
       ing to a merged file.  Clicking BBSSeelleecctt on an unselected
       block adds it to the list of selected blocks.  Clicking
       BBSSeelleecctt on a selected block removes it from the list of
       selected blocks.  In addition, Clicking BBSSeelleecctt on an uns-
       elected block which is opposite a selected block (in the
       other text panes) removes the selected block from the list
       of selected blocks.

       The numbers in the small boxes next to the file names are
       the line numbers of the lines at the top of the text
       panes.

       What follows is the hierarchy of Motif widgets, as gener-
       ated by eeddiittrreess(1).  The hierarchical structure of the
       widget tree is reflected in the indentation.  Each line
       consists of the widget class name followed by the widget
       instance name.  This information might be useful if you
       wish to customize the appearance of the program via
       resource settings.

       Using BBDDrraagg in the overview area doesn't work well when
       drag scrolling is turned off.

       Doesn't support monochrome displays.

       Input lines longer than BUFSIZ (see /usr/include/stdio.h)
       are silently truncated.

       The code for parsing and passing arguments to the _d_i_f_f
       command assumes arguments are delimited by white space and
       does not do any quote processing.
