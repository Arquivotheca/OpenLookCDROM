Pixedit is a tool for interactively modifying the X colormap.  It
allows you to dynamically change the colormap cell for a specific
pixel on the screen.  It works well for picking out one's desired
colors, and then taking the hex RGB specification and putting it in
one's .Xdefaults.

There is a related program, cpicker, which displays a window's
colormap and allows you to select and edit a particular cell.

Pixedit and cpicker require X/Motif.
