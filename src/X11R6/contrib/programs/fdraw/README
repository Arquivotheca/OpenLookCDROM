Fdraw is a simple graphics editor that supports instancing and
embedding widgets.

Usage:

1) Esc toggles between edit mode and run mode.  For example, a push
button behaves like a composed graphical object in edit mode and 
a regular push button in run mode.

2) Shift-select on an unselected object adds it to the selection list

3) Shift-select on a selected object narrows the selection to its
child

4) Control-(move, scale or rotate) manipulates the shared instance of a
selected object (which potentially affects other objects sharing the
same instance).
