What is Canna?

       Canna is a Japanese input system available in Free Software.
Canna provides a unified user interface for inputing Japanese.

       Canna supports Nemacs(Mule), kinput2 and canuum.  All of these
tools can be used by a single customization file, romaji-to-kana
conversion rules and conversion dictionaries, and input Japanese in
the same way.

       Canna converts kana to kanji based on a client-server model and
supports automatically kana-to-kanji conversion.
