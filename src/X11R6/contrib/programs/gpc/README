             Graphics Performance Charaterization
                Picture Level Benchmark Program
                Benchmark Interface Format 1.1
                     PEX_SI PEX5R1_beta

  This version has been tested with the current DIS c-binding. It is as
close to a complete version of the PLB as is currently possible.

  There are still issues being addressed at the Graphics Performance
Characterization (GPC) committee with regards to NURBS. Therefore this
release does not implement NURB curve or NURB surface. The other primitive
which is not supported is PIXEL_MAP.

  There were two reported bugs fixed in the version, file names too long
(greater than 14 characters), and cull-mode.

  Things added since the last release:

   o Exception reporting based on inquires from the opened workstation.

   o Configuration parameter WINDOW_SIZE added. The default size has been
     changed to 900x720. The new CONFIGURATION syntax should now read:

       CONFIGURATION                        % Specify graphics configuration  %
       [< RGB | CIE | HSV | HLS >]          % Color model used in color specs %
                                            % Default is RGB                  %
       [< DOUBLE_BUFFER | SINGLE_BUFFER >]  % Set display buffer mode         %
                                            % Default is DOUBLE_BUFFER        %
       [< TRUE_COLOR | PSEUDO_COLOR >]      % Define the color method used    %
                                            % Default is TRUE_COLOR           %
       [ WINDOW_SIZE width height ]         % Size of the window              %
                                            % Default 900 720                 %
       ;                                    % End CONFIGURATION               %

   o New command line options and Xresources to better support the PLB 
     and PEX in the X Window System. The following are the new options:

         Command line                  Resource              Value

          -display                    ".display"     String for X display
                                                     connection.

          -geometry                   ".geometry"    Size and position
                                                     in X notation.

                                                     the CONFIGURATION)

                                                     border in X color
                                                     notation.

          -bg                         ".background"  Color for the window
                                                     background in X color
                                                     notation. (Will over-

                                                     or BACKGROUND_COLOR_INDEX
                                                     in the verb file)

          -bw                         ".borderWidth" Width of the window
                                                     border in pixels.

          -hlhsr                      ".hlhsrMode"   One of the following:
                                                     (case is not significant)
                                                           NONE
                                                           ZBUFF
                                                           PAINTERS
                                                           SCANLINE
                                                           LINE
                                                     These modes may not
                                                     exist on every platform.

          -buff                       ".bufferMode"  One of the following:
                                                     (case is not significant)
                                                           SINGLE
                                                           DOUBLE
                                                     (Will override buffer
                                                     mode in the CONFIGURATION)

   o New directories, tests and benchmarks. Documentation for the test files
     are in that directory. The benchmarks are the GPC approved files.

   o Reporting entries related to a specific vendor are filled out at run
     time by inquires from the connected X server.


  This version creates its own window and uses the same methods as the API
for looking for the correct visual. It has not been tested on servers with
greater than 8-bit depths. I expect this is an area which will require some
extra attention.

  The parser used for the PLB was created with yacc. I have found that not
all implementations of yacc can successfully compile the bifparse.y file.
Therefore, I have renamed the file to bifparse.yacc and added a target in
the Imakefile for bifparse. The files bifparse.c and bifparse.h were created
from this target.
