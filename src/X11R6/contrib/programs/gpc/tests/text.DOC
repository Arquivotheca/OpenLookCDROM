 COMMENTS ON PHOTOGRAPHS:
 
 	*  Char_up_vector is malfunctioning in the photographs.
 		Row 2 Column 1 and 3 should have their characters
 		slanted in the direction shown in the photographs
 		but their path should remain as they are in the other
 		4 cells.
 
 	*  The text size (for the text at toe bottom of the screen )
 		was reduced from the size on the photograph.  Additional
 		information has been added to that text.
