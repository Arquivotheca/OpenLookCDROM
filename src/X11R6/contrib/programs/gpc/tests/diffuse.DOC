 NAME:			diffuse
 
 CELL CONTENTS:
 	Each cell contains two hemispheres.  One hemisphere is 
 	positioned to the lower left of the other.  The hemisphere to the
 	lower left partially occludes the other.  The radius of each 
 	hemisphere is 80.  The center of the sphears the hemispheres were 
 	cut from are positioned at 20, -20, 100 for the front (lower left) 
 	and -20, 20 -100 for the back (lower left).  The front hemisphere 
 	is constructed with frontfacing facets while the back hemisphere 
 	is constructed with backfacing facet (thier per-vertex/per_facet 
 	normals are given as back facing, but if calculated by the rules 
 	for each primitive they would be frontfacing.  Within a cell all 
 	attributes are constant, however some attributes will effect the 
 	frontfacing facet and others will effect the backfacing facet.
 
 	Of the 10 variations of this test the output primitive used 
 	to create the facet is:
 
|	(diffuse.v01 - diffuse.v02) use "Polygon3" as the facets.
|	(diffuse.v03 - diffuse.v04) use "Fill_area_set3" as the facets.
|	(diffuse.v05 - diffuse.v06) use "Triangle3" as the facets.
|	(diffuse.v07 - diffuse.v08) use "Quad_mesh3" as the facets.
|	(diffuse.v09 - diffuse.v10) use "Index_polygon3" as the facets.
|	(diffuse.v11 - diffuse.v12) use "Non_uniform_bspline_surface" as the facets.
