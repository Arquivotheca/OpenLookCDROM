 NAME: 			line
 
 CELL CONTENTS:
 	Each cell contains 3 line and 3 line3 entities (with per vertex 
 	color).  The 3 line primitives make a reversed Z shape of a 
 	solid color (given in a table in COLUMN VARIABLES).  The 3 line3 
 	primitives make up a 'Z'.  The first vertex color (given in a 
 	table in COLUMN VARIABLES).  The following three vertex colors 
 	are RED, WHITE, and BLUE respectively.

 COMMENTS ON PHOTOGRAPHS:
 
 	*  Line width had no effect in photographs.
 
 	*  Line type had no effect in the photographs.  They should be:
 		Row 1:	_____	(solid  )
 		Row 2:	_ _ _ 	(dash   )
 		Row 3:	.....	(doted  )
 		Row 4:	_._._	(dashdot)
 		Row 5:	_____	(solid  )
 		Row 6:	_ _ _ 	(dash   )
 		Row 7:	.....	(doted  )
 		Row 8:	_._._	(dashdot)

|	*  Line shading had no effect in the photographs (it was always
|	   on).  They should be:
|		Row 1:  no line shading.
|		Row 2:  line shading as shown.
|		Row 3:  no line shading.
|		Row 4:  line shading as shown.
|		Row 5:  no line shading.
|		Row 6:  line shading as shown.
|		Row 7:  no line shading.
|		Row 8:  line shading as shown.
  
 	*  The text size (for the text at toe bottom of the screen )
 		was reduced from the size on the photograph.  Additional
 		information has been added to that text.
