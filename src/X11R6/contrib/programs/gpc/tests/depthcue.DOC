 NAME:			depthcue
 
 CELL CONTENTS:
 	Each facet is constructed in the z=0 plane to the dimensions
 	shown below.  HLHS_Removal is enabled when this cell is drawn
 	in the first column (see CELL LAYOUT), and disabled when this
 	cell is drawn in the second column.  HLHS_Removal is then 
 	disabled and the line and text information is also constructed
 	in the z=0 plane.  This should cause them to be drawn on top 
 	of the facet with no z-buffer bleeding.  This cell is then 
 	scaled and translated into the correct position as described 
 	in CELL LAYOUT.

 CELL LAYOUT:
 	Cells are arranged on the screen in two diagonal columns.  Each
 	column consists of 7 rows.  The primitive used to construct the
 	facet for each cell is listed below.  The cells in column 1
 	should appear to be depthcued correctly while the cells in
 	column 2 should appear to be depthcued backwards (this is because
 	HLHS_Removal is always disabled for this column.  Note that
 	perspective will also look funny for this column for the same
 	reason.  The cell in Column 1 Row 1 is the nearest.  The cell
 	in Column 2 Row 1 is the most distant.).

 COMMENTS ON PHOTOGRAPHS:
 
 	*  Depthcue is malfunctioning in the photographs.
 		Column 1 Row 1 should have a white facet, black
 		lines, and red text.  This should fade toward the
 		background color until Column 2 Row 1 is all in
 		the background color and cannot be seen.
 
 	*  Text is not being displayed.  See CELL CONTENTS for a
 		description of the text.
 
 	*  The text size (for the text at toe bottom of the screen )
 		was reduced from the size on the photograph.  Additional
 		information has been added to that text.
