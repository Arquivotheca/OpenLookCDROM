XCOMM we do a top level make clean.
XCOMM

XCOMM What follows is just a place-holder.  It is the intention to later
XCOMM generate os.h from an autoconf script, but for now it's just a bit too
XCOMM complex so we wimp out and copy from a template.  This still means that
XCOMM you can at least butcher os.h to your heart's content in order to get emu
XCOMM to compile without damaging anything permanantly.

all: os.h

os.h: os.h_tmpl
	@echo Creating os.h.
	@cp os.h_tmpl os.h

clean::
	rm -f os.h

depend:: os.h
