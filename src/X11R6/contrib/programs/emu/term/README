This directory contains the source for the Term widget. It is
broken up into one top level directory with two subdirectories.
Organization is as follows:

./		Various declarations, entry points required by the X11
		toolkit and generic operating system interface code +
		hooks for system dependent modules (see ./sysdep/)

./parser/	The trie parser (see parser/README for a fuller description)
		

./sysdep/	The system dependent portions of the term widget. This
		is where all the grotty tty and process handling stuff
		is handled on a system-by-system basis.
