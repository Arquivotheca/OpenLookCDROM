This directory contains the code for several "hard" parsers as well
as the code for parsing and executing "soft" parsers.  For further
clarification of this technology, one is encouraged to read the
documentation, but roughly speaking a "hard" parser is one that
is hard coded into emu.  Examples can be found in parse_dumb.c and
parse_hemu.c.  "Soft" parsers are loaded and parsed at run time by
code in trie.c and iops.c.

When adding hard parsers, the name of the hard parser in question
must be added to parser.c so that emu knows not to look for
a soft parser by the same name.  Look at the parseTab structure
in parser.c for more information.
