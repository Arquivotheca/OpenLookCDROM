Additions, extensions, etc. to do

emu

- Write a graphics canvas and investigate the feasibility of having emu
  swap different canvases in and out. The other possibility would be to
  have the emu client manage multiple term/canvas pairs, somehow under
  user control.

- See if we can't somehow eliminate the dual buffer usage in parseGeneric().
  It should work just to write to the save buf directly thus preventing a
  very frequent copy operation, but I don't have time to look into this
  before the first release.

- The whole mechanism for ROP_INIT_XXX sequences needs to be thought out
  a little more. When and where exactly should each one be called? What
  exactly are they all supposed to do? What if you want a set of ROPS to
  be universal across different emulations?

canvas

- Restore screen upon exit of programs, such as editors (vi).

- Find the lurking bugs in the double sized fonts support and
  get the selection mechanism to work right under all circumstances.


menus

- Redo Motif menus implementation.  Current version uses XmCreatePopupMenu
  convenience function which restricts the popping up and down actions.
  This doesn't allow for the same interaction as with the Athena menus.
