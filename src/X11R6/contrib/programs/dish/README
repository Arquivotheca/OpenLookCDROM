Dish (Dynamic Invocation SHell) is a Tcl application that allows
invocation of Fresco objects through a scripting interface.  Users can
bind Fresco objects to Tcl variables and commands and directly invoke
operations that are supported by these objects.

The 'scripts' directory contains example scripts (Try source scripts/circle).
The Fresco Reference Manual shows the operations supported by the Fresco
objects.  Tcl documentation is available from sprite.berkeley.edu.
