Things That'd Be Nice, But I'm Not Going To Do:
-------
two types of moving: fast and slow (shift+arrow and arrow)
finish util/flipconfig.perl script 
add XPM support to handle color pixmaps
nicer intro screen
teleport fatality (only if no teleport all round, end with teleport)
reverse video electrocution, instead of blue
reflect-o shots (blocked projectiles go back to originator)
