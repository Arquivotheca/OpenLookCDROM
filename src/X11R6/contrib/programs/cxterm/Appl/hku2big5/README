About HKU Big5 and ETen Big5
============================

The situation is really complicated with the Chinese encoding standard
used in Hong Kong and Taiwan.  In addition of Big5, which is widely used,
there are other standards and de facto standards.  Even different vendors
may have slightly different versions of Big5.

A depreciated "so-called" HKU-Big5 encoding has been widely spread with
the X window font hku-ch16.  It is not compatible with ETen Big5, a
popular Big5 encoding that is said to be used by 90% of users.  Although
cxterm is encoding independent, if you use the font hku-ch16 with cxterm,
the Chinese text you create are in HKU-Big5.  You need to convert them
back to ETen Big5.

If you used ETen Big5 fonts, such as the taipei serials, your files are
already in ETen Big5 and you don't need to read on.

The major difference between the ETen Big5 and HKU Big5 codings is
the offset of non-frequent Big5 Hanzi codes in the ETen coding scheme:
(the legal 2nd byte is 0x40--0x7e and 0xa1--0xfe)

    portions of BIG5 codes    coding in ET Big5   coding in HKU-Ch16
    ----------------------    ----------------    ----------------
    Non-Chinese symbols       0xa140 -- 0xa3bf    0xa140 -- 0xa3fe
    Frequent (5401)           0xa440 -- 0xc67e    0xa440 -- 0xc67e
    Non-frequent (7652)       0xc940 -- 0xf9d5    0xc6a1 -- 0xf755
    Non-BIG5 supplement       0xf9d6 -- ??          no

A program et2hku (or, sometime renamed as et2hkubig5, or et2b5) is
supplied in this directory to convert text file between this two
coding format.  To convert your files in HKU-Big5 to ETen, type:

	et2hku -e < your-file-in-hku-b5 > your-new-file-in-et-big5


If you had been using HKU Big5 in cxterm and want to switch
===========================================================

A easy way is to use the new fonts and dictionaries come with the
new cxterm (X11R6).  If you have your own HKU-Big5 dictionaries
or HKU-Big5 fonts and want to carry them to use in X11R6 cxterm,
you need to do the following steps:

1) convert hku-ch16.bdf font to ETen encoding.  (If you already have ETen
   encoding fonts, this step is optional.)  Assume your hku-ch16.bdf is
   put in ~/xfonts.

	% font-hku2et-ch16.sh ~/xfonts

2) redo all the font installation steps ("bdftosnf" or "bdftopcf",
   "mkfontdir", "xset", etc).

3) convert all your cxterm dictionaries to ETen encoding.  Assume your .tit
   format dictionaries are in ~/src/cxterm/Dict/ (or ~/src/cxterm/dict/tit/
   in X11R5 cxterm).

	% make					# produce et2hku first.
	% tit-hku2et.sh ~/src/cxterm/Dict/

4) rebuild and reinstall the dictionaries.

	% (cd ~/src/cxterm/; make install)
