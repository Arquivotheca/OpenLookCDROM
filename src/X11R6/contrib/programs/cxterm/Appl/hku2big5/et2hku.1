.TH ET2HKUBIG5 1 "22 May 1991" "Public Domain" "Chinese Utility"
.SH NAME
et2hku \- conversion between the ETEN and HKU Big5 Hanzi code
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B et2hku
[-h|-e|-r] [-o \fIoutput_file\fP] [\fIinput_file\fP]
.br
.B et2hkubig5
[-h|-e] [-o \fIoutput_file\fP] [\fIinput_file\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Chinese text generated from ETEN cannot be read directly in 
X window using HKU Big5 encoding hku-ch16 font, or vice versa.
This is because the Hanzi layout in ETEN encoding scheme is
different from that of HKU Big5 encoding scheme.
The \fIet2hku\fP program converts Chinese text between
these two codings.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-h\fP
Convert from ETEN to HKU Big5 (default).
.IP \fB\-r\fP
Reverse conversion.  Convert from HKU Big5 to ETEN.
.IP \fB\-e\fP
Convert from HKU Big5 to ETEN.
.IP "\fB\-o\fP \fIoutput_file\fP"
Store the output in an output file instead of sending it to standard
output (stdout).
.PP
If \fIinput_file\fP is not specified, input will be read from standard
input (stdin).
.SH "FORMAT DETAILS"
The major difference between the ETEN and HKU Big5 codings is
the offset of non-frequent Big5 Hanzi codes in the ETEN coding scheme:
.br
(the legal 2nd byte is 0x40--0x7e and 0xa1--0xfe)
.sp
.nf
portions of BIG5 codes    coding in ETEN      coding in HKU-Ch16

.SH BUGS
The situation is really complicated with the Chinese encoding standard
used in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
In addition of Big5, which is widely used, there are other standards
and de facto standards.
Even different vendors may have slightly different versions of Big5.
HKU-Big5 is a version of Big5 defined by X window font hku-ch16,
which is the only freely available font known to us.
