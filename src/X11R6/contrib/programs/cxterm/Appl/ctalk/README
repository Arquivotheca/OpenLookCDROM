ctalk -- 8-bit clean "talk" program for Unix.
         Can be used on cxterm.

--------
If you get the error message in compiling:

ld: Undefined symbol
   _herror

remove the line with herror in get_addrs.c.  It is merely for announcing
error message in ctalk.

--------
If your system don't have ntalk (BSD 4.3 talkd) service.  You probably
cannot use ctalk.  Directory ntalkd contains the source code of ntalkd,
just for those who want to install ntalk into /etc/service and
/etc/inetd.conf.
