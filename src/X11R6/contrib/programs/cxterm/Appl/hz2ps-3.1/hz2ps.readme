	This is a maintainance update to replace the directory path
	environment variable HZFONTDIR by HBFPATH, which is supported
	by the latest "hbf.c" by Ross Paterson.  Users can now specify
	a list of paths to search instead of a single path. The new "hbf.c"
	takes care of the operating system dependent problems of file path
	names, and thus make hzview more portable.  Moreover, you now
	have to type in the hbf file name with extension, i.e., "ccs24.hbf"
	rather than just "ccs24".

	The prolog file "hz2ps.pro" is now under a directory indicated
	by a new environment variable HZLIB.  You have to setevn HZLIB
	to the directory containing "hz2ps.pro".

	----------------------------------------------------------

***************************************************************************/


The biggest change in this version is the adoption of HBF as the only hanzi
font format. 

The HBF API assumed in this program is documented in the article
"Hanzi Bitmap Font (HBF) File Format Standard Version 1.0", written
by Man-Chi Pong.  
The article can be obtained by ftp from ifcss.org:software/fonts/HBF 
as "HBF_std_v1.0".

The HBF API implementation as in the files "hbf.c", "hbf.h", was written
by Ross Paterson <rap@doc.ic.ac.uk>.

Some .hbf files can be obtained by ftp from ifcss.org:software/fonts/HBF;
corresponding font bitmap files are in the software/fonts directory.
Users are recommended to put the .hbf files and the bitmap files
and the PostScript prolog file "hz2ps.pro" into the same directory, and
setenv HZFONTDIR equal to that directory. 
For example, if that font directory is called /user/me/fonts, then type
% setenv HZFONTDIR /user/me/fonts

To compile the program, type
% make hz2ps

To test the program, type
% make test0
% make test1
% make test2
% make test3


You may get the .hbf files and (raw bitmap) font files from the archive site
ifcss.org:software/fonts.

   NAME
     hz2ps (version 3.1) - convert a hanzi (GB/BIG5) file to PostScript

   SYNTAX
     hz2ps [ options ] [ file ]

   DESCRIPTION
     The hz2ps program converts a GB or BIG5 hanzi file to PostScript. It
     supports both horizontal and vertical printing mode with or without page
     numbering.  All or parts of the file can be selected for conversion.
     Other printing options and fonts can also be chosen.

     The possible options are

     -gb  use GB encoding. This is the default.

     -big use BIG5 encoding.

     -h   horizontal printing mode. This is the default.

     -v   vertical printing mode.

     -margin left  right  bottom  top
          margins measured in inches from lower left corner of a page.
          Default is -margin 1 7.5 1 10.

     -ls line-spacing
          line height (width) in horizontal (vertical) printing mode, meas-
          ured in points (1 in = 72 points).  Default is -ls 15.

     -htab n
          number of hanzi between two adjacent tabs.  Default is 4.

     -hf hanzi-font  point-size  inter-hanzi-spacing
          measure in points. Default is -hf ccs24.hbf 10 1.

     -af ascii-font  point-size  width  descender
          Default is -af Courier 10 6 2.

     -pf page-number
          first page to be printed.

     -pl page-number
          last page to be printed.

     -pnp left  bottom
          positions to print page number, measured in inches from the lower
          left corner of a page.  Default is -pnp 4.15 0.5.

     -pnoffset number
          offset to be added to get the printed page numbers.  Default is 0.
          This is useful if you want contiguous page numbering when a docu-
          ment is stored in several files.


                                                                            1






   hz2ps(1)                                                   10 October 1993


     -nopn
          no page number to be printed.

     If the environment variable HBFPATH is set, (e.g. setenv HBFPATH
     "~/hanzi/hbf:/usr/local/hanzi/fonts/hbf"), hzview will search for the
     HBF (header) file under each directory in the path list HBFPATH in
     order.  Otherwise, the current directory is the default directory.
