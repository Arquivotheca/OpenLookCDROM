INTRODUCTION
============

	C-Elvis is a clone of vi/ex, the standard UNIX editor. C-Elvis
	supports editing of Chinese text, English text, and the mixture
	of both. C-Elvis supports nearly all the vi/ex commands, in both
	vi[sual] mode and ex (colon) mode, for both Chinese and English
	characters.

	C-Elvis is for both GB2312-80 standard (GuoBiao) Chinese internal
	encoding and Big-5 encoding Chinese text.

	C-Elvis requires a Chinese terminal to input/output Chinese
	character.  An example is the X11R4/X11R5 cxterm.

INSTALLATION
============

	You can get the source code of C-Elvis by anonymous ftp to
	cs.purdue.edu (128.10.2.1).  The compressed tar file celvis.tar.Z
	is under the directory ftp:/pub/ygz.  In the same directory you
	may find some Chinese fonts and a X Window Chinese terminal
	emulator cxterm.

	The Makefile contains the necessary steps to compile C-Elvis.  The
	command name is "celvis" by default, but you may rename it or make
	the following aliases of celvis:

	    cvi	    starts up in vi (visual) editing mode, same as celvis;
	    cex	    starts up in ex (line) editing mode;
	    cview   runs vi without write permission, i.e. read-only;
	    cedit   starts up in insert mode.

	MS-DOS user may simply get the binary version of celvis in the same
	ftp directory, named celvis.zip, in ZIP archive format.  Before you
	run CELVIS.EXE, you should  1) either have a directory named "\tmp"
	created or have the MS-DOS variable TMP set to some temporary
	directory;  2) make sure TERM is not set (by DOS command "set TERM=").

	You shouldn't have too much problems if you are familiar with UNIX 
	vi/ex.  The most visible difference between (C-)Elvis and vi/ex is
	that (C-)Elvsi does side-scroll instead of wrapping a line which
	is longer than the width of the screen.  "elvis.man" contains the
	usages of all the commands and keys which you may want to know.

PORTABILITY
===========

	This version of C-Elvis is developed and tested on Sun SparcStation
	and X11R4/X11R5 cxterm.  It also works under ETen DOS.  The original
	Elvis 1.3 also runs under BSD UNIX, AT&T SysV UNIX, Minix, MS-DOS,
	among many others.  The code for these operating systems remains in
	C-Elvis, but is never tested.

	We welcome any attempt to try C-Elvis on other UNIX workstations,
	or any Chinese DOS.  Please refer to elvis.man for guides.

DISTRIBUTION
============

	This version of C-Elvis is freely redistributable, in either
	source form or executable form.  It is provided "as is" without
	express or implied warranty.

	C-Elvis is based on Steve Kirkendall's Elvis 1.3, a public domain
	vi/ex clone.  We appreciate Steve Kirkendall for writing this
	wonderful elvis, and granting us the permission to develop
	C-Elvis based on it and redistribute it.

BUGS & TODO
===========

	You are welcome to mail comments, bug-reports, and modification
	to "c-elvis@cs.purdue.edu".  We are going to create a mailing list
	of those who are interested in the future development of this
	software.  So if you get a copy, and/or you want to be on the
	list, please send mail to "c-elvis@cs.purdue.edu".
