This program converts an X11 BDF font into a raw bitmap font.  It
shouldn't matter what size the font is.  There are no bit and byte
order considerations handled in this version; that will come later.

Use "Makefile.def" to compile the program if you don't have imake.

This program has only been *personally* tested on a SPARC with SunOS
4.1.[123].

The most current copy is always available as:
