This code provides two C interfaces to HBF files: a lightweight one and
the one defined in Appendix 2 of the HBF definition.  Take your pick.

The code appears to work under Unix, MSDOS and VMS.  It has a few features
not specified in the standard:
- if a relative HBF filename is supplied to hbfOpen/HBF_OpenFont, and
  the environment variable HBFPATH is set, the filename is searched for
  relative to the directories listed in HBFPATH (separated by colons in
  Unix, semi-colons in MSDOS, commas in VMS).
- if bitmap filenames in the HBF file are relative, they are taken to
  be relative to the directory containing the HBF file.
- if the word "sideways" is appended to an HBF_CODE_RANGE line, those
  bitmaps are transposed on input.
- there are 2 extra functions hbfForEach() and hbfFileName() that have
  proved useful.
The code should work with little change on other systems, except for
the two relative filename features mentioned above.

To use it, you will need the files hbf.h and hbf.c:
- put #include "hbf.h" in any source file using these functions
- link your program with the object compiled from hbf.c

There are also some sample programs using the interface:

	tester - a simple black-box test program: prints one bitmap
	hbfcmp - compare the bitmaps of two fonts described by HBF files
	hbftobdf - convert an HBF file to the X Windows BDF format

Feel free to use this code, but please send me any bug fixes or other
changes you make, instead of distributing modified versions, so that I
can maintain a consistent master copy.
