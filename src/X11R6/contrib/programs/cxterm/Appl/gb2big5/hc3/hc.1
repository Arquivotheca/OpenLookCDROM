.SH Description
The program
.PN hc
converts a GB file to a BIG-5 file, or a BIG-5 file to a GB file.
GB (GuoBiao) refers to the standard implementation of "GB2312-80"
of Mainland China, in which the two bytes representing a GB code
have their most significant bit set to 1.  BIG-5 refers to the Big
Five standard published in 1984 by Taiwan's Institute for Information
Industry. Currently, most popular Chinese systems and programs use either
GB or BIG-5.

The possible options are
.TP
.BI -m
Conversion mode, either g2b or b2g, for GB to BIG-5, or BIG-5 to GB,
respectively. 
.TP
.BI -map
Mapping mode, either one, all, or allbutsymbols. 
Since the mapping between GB and BIG-5 is not unique,
users may request the translation to return the first mapping,
all the mappings, or all the mappings for hanzi but only one mapping
for symbols (e.g. there are two "comma" glyphs defined in BIG-5).
.TP
.BI -t "\ files"
Specify the hanzi conversion table files, usually just "hc.tab" as
described below.

.SH Conversion Table File Format 
The table file contains newline-terminated mapping entries.
Each entry is a two-byte GB code followed by a list of two-byte
BIG5 codes.  Each entry line cannot exceed 256 characters.
Users may build their own separate table files.
The bundled conversion table file is called "hc.tab".
