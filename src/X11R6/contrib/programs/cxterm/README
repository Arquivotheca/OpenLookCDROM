-------------------------------------------------------------------


1. WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THIS DISTRIBUTION

Cxterm and related software:

cxterm	-- a Chinese terminal emulator for X11R6. 
dict	-- a set of dictionaries (input methods) for cxterm.
utils	-- a set of input methods manipulation programs

Chinese processing software:

Appl	-- a small set of Chinese language processing programs to be used
        in cxterm, including a Chinese vi editor, a file viewer cless,
	a Chinese text to Postscript converter, an on-screen code conversion
	program hztty, some Chinese encoding conversion programs, and the
	HBF font library.

About 5.8M disk space is needed for the source:

	cxterm	 	 719K
	dict	 	1856K
	utils	 	  49K
	Appl	 	2779K
	doc & other	 358K

and additional 10M is needed to build all the binaries.

----------
2. HOW TO INSTALL ALL THESE SOFTWARE

All the path names mentioned here are refer to this directory,
i.e. X11R6/contrib/programs/cxterm.

2.1  CXTERM, UTILS, DICT

First of all you need to have X11R6 MIT core distribution installed
in your system.  The directory containing X11R6 binaries (especially,
xmkmf, imake, etc.) should be included in the PATH.

Imakefiles are supplied in each directories and subdirectories
of cxterm, dict, and fonts.  Makefile is given in this top directory.
Simply type:

	make >& all.log							# (m1)

Check all.log to see if the build is successful.  If yes, you can
install most of it with:

	make install >& install.log					# (i1)

(If you don't have the privilege to install, see section 3.)
You can install man pages with:

	make install.man >& man.log					# (i2)

In case the top-level Makefile is corrupt during the period of making,
use
	make -f Makefile.ini World

2.2  APPL

Individual Makefiles are supplied in every subdirectories under
./Appl.  Each package may need special making procedure, therefore
you need go down to each subdirectory of ./Appl and read the README
and Makefile first.

----------
3. WHAT IS TO BE GENERATED

If the build (m1) is successful, you have the following executable
binaries:

	cxterm/cxterm
	utils/tit2cit
	utils/cit2tit
	utils/hzimpath

The following cxterm dictionaries are built:

	dict/gb/CCDOSPY.cit
	dict/gb/CTCPS3.cit
	dict/gb/English.cit
	dict/gb/PY.cit
	dict/gb/Punct.cit
	dict/gb/SW.cit
	dict/gb/TONEPY.cit

	dict/big5/CangJie.cit
	dict/big5/ETZY.cit
	dict/big5/PY.cit
	dict/big5/Punct.cit
	dict/big5/Simplex.cit
	dict/big5/ZOZY.cit

You can put all of them in a dedicated directory and set environment
variable HZINPUTDIR to the directory name before invoking cxterm.

The following manual pages are useful:

	cxterm/cxterm.man
	utils/tit2cit.man
	utils/hzimpath.man

----------
4. HOW TO RUN CXTERM

First, you need to load the X Window application resources in file
"./cxterm/CXterm.ad" (or put them in the right applcation default
files).  The environment variable HZINPUTDIR should be set the
the the directory name that contains all the compiled cxterm
dictionaries (usually "/usr/local/X11R6/lib/X11/cxterm.dic", check
the output of "make install" for sure).  You may also choose to
set the cxterm input search path in X resources (see cxterm.man).

To run cxterm in GB mode:

	cxterm -name cxterm &

in Big5 mode (assuming the Big5 font is installed):

	cxterm -name cxtermb5 &

in JIS mode:

	cxterm -name cxtermjis &

in KS mode:

	cxterm -name cxtermks &


----------
5. ENCODING AND FONTS

Cxterm is encoding independent.  You can use cxterm in any encoding
with proper fonts and input dictionaries.

The enclosed input dictionaries are in four encoding schemes, GB, 
Big5, JIS and KS.  GB is an official standard for Chinese character
in China.  Big5 is a de facto standard used in Taiwan and Hong Kong.
There are several different implementations of Big5.  We use ETen
Big5 as the reference Big5 standard in this package.  (The HKU-Big5
adopted in X11R5 cxterm is no longer supported.)  JIS is a Japanese
standard and KS is a Korean standard.

Fonts are not included in this package.  There are three GB encoding
Chinese in X11R6 core distribution (X11R6/xc/fonts/bdf/misc/gb*.bdf).
Big5 fonts can be found in several Internet ftp sites, e.g.,
ftp.cs.purdue.edu: /pub/ygz/x-fonts/hku16et.bdf, and more at
ftp.csie.nctu.edu.tw: /pub/Chinese/x-win/cxterm-fonts/.

7. COMMENTS, BUG-REPORTS, AND FIXES

This cxterm has been tested on Sun3 (SunOS 4.0), Sun SPARCs
(SunOS 4.1 and SunOS 5.3), SGI (IRIX 5.2), and PC clones (Linux).

Please send comments, bug-reports, and fixes to c-xterm@cs.purdu.edu.
If possible, please use the form in the file "bug-report".  The little
extra time you spend on the report will make it much easier for us to
reproduce, find, and fix the bug.  Receipt of bug reports is generally
acknowledged.

If you have trouble installing cxterm, check ./Doc/ first.  You might
find some hints there.  Also check the cxterm master ftp site,
ftp.cs.purdue.edu: pub/ygz/.  You may find new patches, new input
methods, etc.

8. MASTER CXTERM SITE

The master cxterm site is ftp.cs.purdue.edu: pub/ygz/.  We have a large
collection of old and new versions, FAQs, patches, ports, fonts, input
methods, etc.  Future improvements of cxterm will also be put there.
