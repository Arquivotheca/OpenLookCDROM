Directory "input/" is from Liangsheng Wu's wb-cj-input.zip.
I added wbb.ps and cjb.ps, which are converted from the *.pcx file.
In addition to print out the postscript file, you may view the .pcx
files in X window using the "xloadimage" program.  You may also
convert the .pcx to other image formats using the "pbm" package.
(e.g. "pcxtoppm | ppmtopgm | pgmtopbm" )

Directory "tutorial/" is from Yu Huang's learning_wubi.zip.
