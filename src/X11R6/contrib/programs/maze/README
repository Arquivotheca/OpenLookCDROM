[ maze ]

This was a SunView demo program which has been hacked to run under X11.  The
program creates a "random" maze and then solves the maze with graphical
feedback to the user.  After a given maze is solved, another is created.  The
mouse can be used to control this process to some degree.

  "Right"  mouse click --> causes the program to exit...  
  "Left"   mouse click --> causes a new maze pattern to be created...
  "Middle" mouse click --> toggles the maze off and on (ie. stop/start)...

Enjoy...
