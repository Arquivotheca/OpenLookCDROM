You can find detailed description of kinput2 protocol in
../doc/protocol (written in Japanese).

Although kinput2 protocol is simple and easy to implement, it is a
non-standard protocol, and there are few input servers which
understand it.  So if you want to make your application general and
portable, maybe using this protocol is not a right way.

Convlib.c is a client-side library for handling kinput2 protocol.  It
is designed to be used with Xt library, so it is difficult for
applications which doesn't use Xt to make use of it.  In such cases,
you should use XIM interface provided by Xlib, and still you can use
kinput2 as the input server via X Input Method Protocol or Ximp
protocol.
