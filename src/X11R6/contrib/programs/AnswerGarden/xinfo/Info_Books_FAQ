Here is an unordered set of the reference books and tutorials most useful for
beginners; most appear on that list [comments are gathered from a variety of 
places and are unattributable]:

Asente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., "X Window System Toolkit, The Complete
Programmer's Guide and Specification", Digital Press, 1990.  The bible on Xt. A 
treasury of information, excellent and invaluable.  Distributed by Digital 
Press, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by Prentice-Hall, 
ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC Direct at 1-800-DIGITAL. 
[The examples are on export.x.org in contrib/ and on gatekeeper.dec.com 
(16.1.0.2) in pub/X11/contrib as asente-swick.examples.tar.Z.  They were also 
posted to comp.sources.x as xt-examples/part0[1-5].]

Jones, Oliver, Introduction to the X Window System, Prentice-Hall, 1988, 1989.
ISBN 0-13-499997-5. An excellent introduction to programming with Xlib.  
Written with the programmer in mind, this book includes many practical tips 
that are not found anywhere else. This book is not as broad as the O'Reilly 
Xlib tutorial, but Jones is an experienced X programmer and this shows in the 
quality and depth of the material in the book. Originally written for X11R1, 
recent printings have included corrections and additions and current material.
 
Young, Doug. "The X Window System: Applications and Programming with Xt (Motif 
Version)," Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8). The excellent tutorial 
"X Window Systems Programming and Applications with Xt," (ISBN 0-13-972167-3) 
updated for Motif. [The examples are available on export; the ones from the 
Motif version are in ~ftp/contrib/young.motif.tar.Z.]

Young, Doug and John Pew, "The X Window System: Programming and Applications 
with Xt, OPEN LOOK Edition" (ISBN 0-13-982992-X). The tutorial rewritten for 
OLIT, with new examples and drag/drop information.

Heller, Dan. "Motif Programmers Manual". The 6th Volume in the O'Reilly series
covers Motif application programming; with reference pages. (ISBN ??)
 
Scheifler, Robert, and James Gettys, with Jim Flowers, Ron Newman, and David 
Rosenthal, "X Window System: The Complete Reference to Xlib, X Protocol, ICCCM,
XLFD, Second Edition," Digital Press, 1990. "The Bible", an enhanced version of
X documentation by the authors of the Xlib documentation. This is the most 
complete published description of the X programming interface and X protocol. 
It is the primary reference work and is not introductory tutorial 
documentation; additional tutorial works will usually be needed by most new X 
programmers.  Digital Press order EY-E755E-DP. DP ISBN 1-55558-050-5;  
Prentice-Hall ISBN 0-13-972050-2

(volume 2).  [A version updated for X11R4 is available (4/90).]

In addition, check the X11R4 core distribution in doc/tutorials for some useful
papers and tutorials, particularly the file doc/tutorials/answers.txt.  "Late 
Night's Top Ten X11 Questions" by Dave Lemke (lemke@ncd.com) and Stuart Marks 
(smarks@sun.com) answers other common questions and some of these here in more 
detail.

New R5 versions of the O'Reilly references should be out in early 1992; volumes
1 and 4 should follow. Volume 4M will be updated when OSF ships 1.2. A single
volume due in November provides an overview of new R5 features; it includes
man pages for Xlib, Xt, and Xmu.
