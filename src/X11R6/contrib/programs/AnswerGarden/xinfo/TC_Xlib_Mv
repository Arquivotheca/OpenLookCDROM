@b(Using the example code)

You should be able to copy and paste the code from these examples
into editor buffers.  Use mouse button 1 to start the copy.  Drag
the mouse with the button 1 down to select a region of the text.
(This can vary if you have set the translations differently in
your resource file.  If this last sentence didn't make any sense,
don't worry about it.)

Unfortunately, what mouse button (or keyboard equivalent) is used
for pasting is dependent on your window manager and/or your
text editor.  You will have to play with it.  If you are using 
a standard configuration, send email here to help your fellow
students - we'll put the correct button configurations here
for them to find.

If you need more information, click the "I'm Unhappy" button and
let us know.
