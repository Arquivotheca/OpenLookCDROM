Almost anything can be tailored in Answer Garden.  Some of the 
things include:

@begin(1)
You can change the label of any button by changing the appropriate
line in the app-defaults file.
@end(1)

@begin(2)
You can change what the beginning (root) nodes are by changing
the "root" and "rootGrapher" resources in the app-defaults file.  
For example, the resources

	AnswerGarden*root:		pa
	AnswerGarden*rootGrapher: 	sis
	AnswerGarden*Control*button4:   view pa
	AnswerGarden*Control*button3:	view sis

will change the Control node (the first node that comes up).
The "By Tree" button will come up saying "view pa".  The
"Ask Questions" button will come up saying "view sis".  The
"view pa" button will bring up the node named "pa", and the
"view sis" button will bring up the node named "sis".  

Note that the name "rootGrapher" is an artifact.  The node need not be
a Grapher.  In fact, either "root" or "rootGrapher" can be any
arbitrary node.
