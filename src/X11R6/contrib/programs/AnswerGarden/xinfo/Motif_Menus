@begin(Q)
What can I put inside a menu bar?
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
You can only put cascade buttons in menu bars. No pushbuttons, toggle
buttons or gadgets are allowed. When you create a pulldown menu with
parent a menu bar, its real parent is a shell widget.

@begin(Q)
Can I have a cascade button without a submenu in a pulldown menu?
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
Yes you can. A cascade button has an activate callback which is called
when you click on it and it doesn't have a submenu. It can have a
mnemonic, but keyboard traversal using the arrow keys in the menu will
skip over it.

@begin(Q)
Should I have a cascade button without a submenu in a pulldown
menu?
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
No. This is forbidden by the style guide. Technically you can do it
(see previous question) but if you do it will not be Motif style
compliant. This is unlikely to change - if a "button" is important
enough to be in a pulldown menu bar with no pulldown, it should be a
button elsewhere.  (Mind you, you won't be able to put accelerators on
it elsewhere though.)
