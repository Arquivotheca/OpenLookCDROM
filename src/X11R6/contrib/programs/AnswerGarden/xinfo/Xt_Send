     I have a Label widget I'm using as a graphics canvas, ...
     I'd like to get a <Configure> event before the very
     first <Expose> event the way raw Xlib programs do,

??? ConfigureNotify events are generated only when the server actually
changes the size of a window in response to a ConfigureWindow request
from some client.  There is no guarantee that the first Exposure event
will be preceeded by a ConfigureNotify for _any_ program.

     I've checked the Label's event mask at various times.  After creating it
     with XtCreateManagedWidget (with the new translations in the arg list),
     only the ExposureMask is on.  Not until after XtRealizeWidget(toplevel) is
     the StructureNotifyMask on.

Since the window doesn't actually exist until the widget is realized,
the R3 Xt implementation does lazy evaluation of the translation table
event mask.  This is a bug, as the spec doesn't say that XtBuildEventMask
may return a bad value for an unrealized widget.

However, this won't change your problem, which is a more conceptual one
(or architectural, depending on your P.O.V. :-).  By design, the initial
geometry of all widgets is established _before_ any windows are created
