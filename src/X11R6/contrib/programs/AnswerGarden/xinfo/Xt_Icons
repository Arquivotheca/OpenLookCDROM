@begin(A)
The details of how an X11 application communicates with a window manager 
(or with another application) are worked out in the Inter-Client
Communications Conventions Manual (aka the ICCCM)...

All toolkit applications, xman included "do" window manager hints, the 
way you specify the location of the icon is through the following resources.

iconX	and 	iconY

% xman -xrm "iconX:+100" -xrm "iconY:+200" -iconic

If your window manager is looking at icon hints then this should pop
up the window as an icon in the position specified.

Thanks to all who responded to my problem concerning the icon geometry.
To solve the problem I had to put 2 backslashes instead of just one.
It works just fine as shown below:

rsh gateway xterm -display "`hostname`":0 -iconic \\#+30+50 -n "Elm" -e elm &

    Is there any way to programmatically iconify a window?

This is covered in Sections 4.1.4 and 4.1.9 of the ICCCM.

  Sure is.  I have each machine I log into send this sequence followed by the
  machine name, so that my window always properly displays the name of the
  machine I am currently logged onto.

>Does anyone know how to do this?

  Just send the sequence: ESC] SOME_STRING
  (that`s ESCape, close square bracket, a space, then some string"
  to change the window name to the string.  (an xterm window that is.)

I don't know about DecWindows, or dxterm, or whatever, but for Andrew
typescript and MIT xterm, you can do the following in your .cshrc:

if ($?TERM) then
  if ($?prompt) then

	set prompt = "! % "
	set hostname = `hostname`

        if ($TERM == "sun") then		# sunview cshell
                alias cd        'chdir \!*; echo -n "^[]l$hostname : $cwd^[\"' ;
        else if ($TERM == "wm") then		# Andrew typescript
                alias cd        'chdir \!*; echo -n "^A$hostname : $cwd^B"' ;
        else if ($TERM == "vt100") then		# really xterm
                alias cd        'chdir \!*; echo -n "^[]l$hostname : $cwd^["' ;
        else if ($TERM == "xterm") then		# xterm
                alias cd        'chdir \!*; echo -n "^[]l$hostname : $cwd^["' ;
        else					# not a labelled window
                alias cd        'chdir \!*; set prompt = "$hostname : $cwd ! % "' ;
	endif

	cd .
  endif
endif

(NB:  Each of the character pairs beginning with ^ (^[, ^B, ^A) is actually
a single character that I've editted so it goes through mail properly.)
