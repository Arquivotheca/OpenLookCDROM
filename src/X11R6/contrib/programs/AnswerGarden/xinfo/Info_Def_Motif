@begin(Q)
What is Motif?
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
Motif itself is made up of four parts: a User- Interface Guideline, an
API toolkit of `C' routines which helps in the building of
applications which conform to the Guideline, the window manager mwm,
and a language UIL which is designed to ease user interface
development.

@begin(Q)
What versions of Motif are there?
@end(Q)

@begin(A) 
Motif 1.0 is based on the R3 toolkit.  There are patch
releases to 1.0: 1.0.1, 1.0.A, 1.0.2 and 1.0.3, 1.0.4, 1.0.5. 1.0.A
was a fairly major patch, as it involved a complete re-engineering of
UIL and Mrm.  Almost everyone who has 1.0.x has either 1.0.A or 1.0.3.
There are not expected to be further patches to 1.0.

Motif 1.1 is based on the R4 toolkit.  The current version is Motif
1.1.0, plus a couple of patches available to full support contract
holders. Motif 1.1.1 has been released as a patch to licensees with
Full Support or Technical Update service.  Motif 1.1.2 is a patch
release which contains the necessary changes to fix over 80 bugs
reported against Motif. It is available to support contract holders
(including both full support and update service).  The 1.1.3 release
fixes a further 150 bugs and is available from August 1991 to support
contract holders (including both full support and update service).
Future 1.1 patch releases are tentatively scheduled as follows:

        1.1.4   4th quarter 1991
        1.1.5   1st half 1992

Motif 1.2 is not expected until early 1992, and will be based on the
R5 toolkit.

@begin(Q) 
Where can I get Motif?
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
    Various hardware vendors produce developer's toolkits of binaries,
header files, and documentation; check your hardware vendor,
particularly if that vendor is an OSF member. Systems known to be
shipping now: HP (sans UIL), Apollo (sans UIL), SCO, ISC, Mips
(RISCwindows=X11R3 + full Motif), IBM, Data General for AViioNs
(includes UIL), Bull (?), Concurrent Computer Corporation 5000, 6000,
8000 series machines, Convex, Sequent.

    In addition, independent binary vendors produce Motif toolkits .
ICS makes several binary kits, notably for Sun, DEC, Apple; Quest
(408-988-8880) sells kits for Suns, as well; IXI (+44 223 462 131)
offers kits for Sun3 (SunOS 3.5 or later, and Sun4 (SunOS 4.0.1 or
later). Unipalm XTech (+44 954211862; or Aurora Technologies
617-577-1288 in USA) offers a binary kit for Suns based on Motif 1.1,
with shared libraries.  NSL (+33 (1) 43 36 77 50; requests@nsl.fr)
offers kits for the Sun 3 and Sun 4.  [An FAQ is for "personal
opinions" on these toolkits.  I don't think it is appropriate to give
such opinions through this particular posting, so I haven't included
any.] In Australia, Information Technology Consultants Pty Ltd has
Motif 1.1.2 for Sun Sparc 4.1 ( phone on (02) 360 6999, fax on (02)
360 6695 or e-mail to motif@itcsyd.itc.oz.au)

  The kits include varied levels of bug-fixing and support for shared
libraries.  BIM (Fax : +32(2)759.47.95) offer Motif 1.1 for Sun-3,
Sun-4, Sun-386i. Includes shared libraries.  Metrolink Inc.
(+1-305-566-9586, sales@metrolink.com; in Europe contact ADNT, (33 1)
3956 5333) ships an implementation of X11R4 and Motif 1.1 for several
386 systems.

    An OSF/Motif source license must be obtained from OSF before
source can be obtained from the Open Software Foundation. Call the
Direct Channel Desk at OSF at 617-621-7300 or email direct@osf.org for
ordering information.  In addition to the full Motif source, "option
C" allows you to purchase source for the window manager mwm to run on
X terminals.

@begin(Q)
Where can I get public domain Motif source?
@end(Q)

@begin(A) 
You cannot.  Motif source is not publically available.

				Motif FAQ 8/12/91

@begin(Q)
Are the Motif examples publically available?
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
OSF has produced a list of which of the example programs can be
distributed. Call OSF Direct for a copy of it.  Most of the example
programs have been freed from distribution limitations so should be
available.

@begin(Q)
Has anyone done a public domain Motif lookalike?
@end(Q)

@begin(A)

Not yet.  The specification is available (AES), and the validation
suite can be bought, but no-one has taken up the challenge.  There are
some commercial lookalikes (Looking Glass and Neuron Data), but no
workalikes.

@begin(Q)
Does OSF have an application compliance validation service?
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
They have a checklist and a certification process which you
can request from them.  Ask for the Level One Certification Checklist.
The process is one of self-certification.  It tests only the
appearance and behavior of the application against Motif style.  The
product will also be put in the OSF reference listing.  There's a
one-time fee of $250.  According to the master license agreement, you
can't use any OSF identifying mark unless you have done a
certification.

@begin(Q)
How does Motif work with X11R5?
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
Motif 1.1.X is only intended to be built with X11R4.  Motif
1.2.X is for X11R5.  however, Motif 1.1.4 has been set to also work
with X11R5.

For versions of Motif before this you will need to compile Xlib and Xt
with a MOTIF_BC flag set to YES (page 8, section 3.3 of the R5 release
notes), or you'll also have a link problem (LowerCase) and a fatal run
time problem (XContext manager).  If your applications come up with
"Unknown keysym name: osfActivate" errors, check the variable
ProjectRoot. The name /$PROJECTROOT/lib/XKeysymDB will have been wired
into your Xlib.

Mrm won't work at all (can't link since it uses an X private variable
that has disappeared in R5).  Thre is an MIT patch that may fix this??
[I confess ignorance of Mrm and UIL].

In Motif 1.1, XtCallCallback uses NULL as the first argument instead
of a widget ID. This was ok under R4, but must be changed in the
source for R5. It was changed by OSF from Motif 1.1.1 onward.
