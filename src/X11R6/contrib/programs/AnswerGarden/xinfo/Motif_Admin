@begin(Q)
When I built the Motif 1.1.x in Sun4, and went to the following
steps:

	rm -f mre.uid
	../.././clients/uil/uil/ - o mre.uid mre.uil -I../.././clients/uil

I got error message:

	Severe: internal error - submit defect report
	*** Error code 1
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
Add -DSTRINGS_ALIGNED to the sun.cf file and rebuilt everything
again.
@end(A)

@begin(Q)
The first time I compile an application after building Motif, I get
a syntax error in Xm.h, around line 1969.  This line mentions
XtPointer.
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
You are using the R3 Xt .h files, probably because they are still
in /usr/include/X11.  You need to install the R4 .h files.  
@end(A)

@begin(Q)
I get an error at runtime...
	Widget class XmMainWindow version mismatch (recompilation needed):
	widget 11004 vs. intrinsics 11003.
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
You compiled R4 Xt with R3 Xt include files
@end(A)

@begin(Q)
I set UIDPATH, but my application can not find the right uid files.
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
You have to add %U at the end of the path. For example, if you want
to specify "/usr/users/x/uid", you say

	setenv UIDPATH /usr/users/x/uid/%U

The document says that you should append %N. It is wrong.
@end(A)

@begin(Q)
I get an error at runtime...
	Widget class XmMainWindow version mismatch:
	widget 11004 vs. intrinsics 11003.
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
You are using an R3 Xt library.

In these cases (and some similar cases) it will be necessary to
trace through the directories indicated by the -I options to cc.
@end(A)

@begin(Q)
I have fix-15 to fix-18, and get an error whem patching TMstate.c
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
First back out fix-osf, and throw it away
@end(A)

@begin(Q)
I got the error "no ext to pop" and the program crashes.
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
Get MIT fix 15 through 18 and patch to your X11R4.
@end(A)

@begin(Q)
I call an XmString procedure with XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET,
and I get a SEGV in strlen().
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
You compiled with 1.0 header files, and linked with 1.1 library
@end(A)
