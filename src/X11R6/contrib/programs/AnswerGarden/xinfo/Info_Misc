Other Information Sources for X
--------------------------------

This node contains information on:
  1.  What X-related (in general) public mailing lists are 
      available?
  2.  What publications discussing X are available?
  3.  How can I meet other X developers? (What is XUG? AFUX? EXUG?)


@begin(Q)
What X-related public mailing lists are available?
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
	The xpert mailing list is the general, public mailing list
on X maintained by the X Consortium. The mailings are gatewayed, so
xpert is almost identical to the comp.windows.x Usenet newsgroup.  

	***	If you get comp.windows.x, you don't need to 	***
	***	be added to the xpert mailing list. 		***

	Otherwise, you can join the list to receive X information
electronically. It is best to find a local distribution; perhaps
someone within your company is already receiving the mailing. As a
last resort, send mail to xpert-request@export.x.org with a
valid return electronic address.  

	A mailing list for major X announcements (new releases,
public reviews, adoption of standards, but NOT advertisements,
patches, or questions) is available by request from
xannounce-request@export.x.org. Messages sent to xannounce will
automatically be sent to the xpert mailing list.  They will not be
sent to the Usenet news group comp.windows.x; however, they will
appear in the Usenet news group comp.windows.x.announce.  Note:
Only redistribution addresses will be accepted for this list --
i.e. no personal addresses. If you wish to receive xannounce
yourself, please contact your mail administrator to set up a local
redistribution list and to put you on it.  

	In addition, the X Consortium sponsors these public lists:
		bug-clx         CLX bug reports and discussions
		x-ada           X and ada
		x11-3d          people interested in X and 3d graphics
		ximage          people interested in image processing and X
		xvideo          discussion of video extensions for X

	To subscribe to one of these lists, assuming no-one in your
organization already receives it, send mail to
<list>-request@export.x.org with the Subject line including the
name of the LIST in caps and the request "addition request".  In
the body of the message be sure to give an address for your local
distribution which is accessible from MIT (eddie.mit.edu).

A mailing list for topics related to OPEN LOOK is sponsored by Greg
Pasquariello of Unify corporation; send to
openlook-request@unify.com (or
openlook-request%unify.uucp@uunet.uu.net) for information.  

	A mailing list for bugs in the publicly-available version
of XView source, in particular, is sponsored by Sun; send for
information to xviewbug-trackers-request@sun.com.  

	A mailing list for topics related to Motif is sponsored by
Kee Hinckley of Alfalfa Software, Inc.; send to
motif-request@alfalfa.com for information.  (This group is
gatewayed to comp.windows.x.motif.)

	A mailing list for topics related to the XPM pixmap-format
is sponsored by Arnaud Le Hors of Group Bull; send to
xpm-talk-request@mirsa.inria.fr for information. [1/91]

	A mailing list discussing InterViews can be subscribed to
by sending to interviews-request@interviews.stanford.edu.

	A mailing list (amiga-x11@nic.funet.fi) for topics related
to the port of X11 to the Amiga can be subscribed by sending to
mailserver@nic.funet.fi a message containing
		Subject: Adding myself to AMIGA-X11
		SUBS AMIGA-X11 Your Real Name
