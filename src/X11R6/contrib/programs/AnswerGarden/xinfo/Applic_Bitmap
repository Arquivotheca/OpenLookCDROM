@begin(Q)
I would like to create my own bitmaps for stipple patterns.  How
do I do this?  The style of bitmap I would like to make is the
same as in ~libe233/bitmaps.  
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
Use the bitmap program:

    bitmap [-options ...] filename WIDTHxHEIGHT

It creates a 1-bit deep bitmap (notice it's not a pixmap, and
therefore it's without color).  It's quite straight-forward, and
there is a man page on it.
