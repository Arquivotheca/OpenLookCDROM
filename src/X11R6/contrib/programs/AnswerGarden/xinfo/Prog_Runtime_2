-----------------------------------------------------------------
If your program is failing without an error or warning message of
any sort, then:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

@begin(E)
The most likely culprit is an incorrect resource setting.  If you
set a resource in a resource file and mis-spell it, *no* error or
warning message ever occurs.  All that happens is that nothing 
happens.

For example, the resource specification:

	AnswerGarden*PushButton.translation:  ...

has two errors in it.  In the Motif set, the push button is
actually called "XmPushButton" for resource files.  For all
widget sets, the translation resource is called "translations",
not "translation".  Either one of these would cause the resource
to fail silently.
@end(E)

@begin(E)
If the symptom is that you get an incorrect color on a monochrome
screen, you may have an incorrect color in your resource file.  For
example, the resource specification

	AnswerGarden*button1.foreground: medium spring green

will map correctly on some monochrome servers to Black.  However
on others it will map to white (drawing white on white).
@end(E)

If you are drawing using Xlib level code, and you do not seem
to get any output, check your GC.  On some machines (typically
Suns), the default foreground (ie, drawing) color is White.
You must explicitedly set the drawing color in the GC.  Some 
sample code is:

	XSetForeground(XtDisplay(some_widget),the_GC,
		       BlackPixelOfScreen(XtScreen(some_widget)));
