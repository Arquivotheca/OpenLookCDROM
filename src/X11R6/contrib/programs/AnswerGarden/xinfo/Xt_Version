The only circumstance under which you should get this message
is that one or more widgets was compiled with a different set of
header files than the libXt.a was compiled with.  If you are using
the libXt.a shipped with your system, then make sure that the
Xt header files in /usr/include/X11 are also those that were shipped
with your system (particularly Intrinsic.h).
