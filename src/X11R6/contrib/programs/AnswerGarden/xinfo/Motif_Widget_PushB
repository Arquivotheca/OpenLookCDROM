@begin(Q)
Why can't I use accelerators on buttons not in a menu?
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
It is apparently a difficult feature to implement, but OSF are
considering this for the future. It is problematic trying to use the
Xt accelerators since the Motif method interferes with this.  The
workaround suggested so far is to duplicate your non-menu button by a
button in a menu somewhere, which does have a menu-accelerator
installed.  When the user invokes what they think is the accelerator
for the button they can see Motif actually invokes the button on the
menu that they can't see at the time.
