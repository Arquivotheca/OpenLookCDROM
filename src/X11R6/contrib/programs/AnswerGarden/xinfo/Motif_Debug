@begin(Q)
I get an error at runtime...
	Widget class XmMainWindow version mismatch (recompilation needed):
	widget 11004 vs. intrinsics 11003.
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
You compiled R4 Xt with R3 Xt include files
@end(A)

@begin(Q)
I have a call:
      XtIsSubclass(widget, XmCascadeButton)
but, the compiler complains:

    "cadtool.c", line 175: error:  XmCascadeButton undefined

I have CascadeB.h included.  What is the problem?
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
The call requires a widget class (called the class pointer in the
Motif documentation), not the widget's resource name (called the
class name in the Motif documentation).  Use
xmCascadeButtonWidgetClass.  See the documentation for more
information.

@begin(Q)
I get an error at runtime...
	Widget class XmMainWindow version mismatch:
	widget 11004 vs. intrinsics 11003.
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
You are using an R3 Xt library.

In these cases (and some similar cases) it will be necessary to
trace through the directories indicated by the -I options to cc.
@end(A)

@begin(Q)
I set UIDPATH, but my application can not find the right uid files.
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
You have to add %U at the end of the path. For example, if you want
to specify "/usr/users/x/uid", you say

	setenv UIDPATH /usr/users/x/uid/%U

The document says that you should append %N. It is wrong.
@end(A)

@begin(Q)
I get a SEGV in strlen().  I am calling XmString procedure with
XmSTRING_DEFAULT_CHARSET,
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
You compiled with 1.0 header files, and linked with 1.1 library
@end(A)

@begin(Q)
The first time I compile an application after building Motif, I get
a syntax error in Xm.h, around line 1969.  This line mentions
XtPointer.
@end(Q)

@begin(A)
You are using the R3 Xt .h files, probably because they are still
in /usr/include/X11.  You need to install the R4 .h files.  
@end(A)
