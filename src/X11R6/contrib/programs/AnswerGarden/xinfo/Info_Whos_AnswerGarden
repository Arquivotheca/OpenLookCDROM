@b(Who's Responsible for AnswerGarden?)

Answer Garden is the product of many people.  You just
can't do something like this alone.  This was a community
effort.

Thanks to the members (present and former) of the X Consortium that
really made this possible: Bob Schiefler, Ralph Swick, Donna
Converse, Chris Peterson, Stephen Gildea, and Keith Packard. 
Additional thanks to Tom Malone (who had the original idea for
Answer Garden and has been a great help throughout), Chris Schmandt
(another great help), Debby Hindus, Eric Mandel, John Roll, Klaus
Elsbernd, der Mouse, Rodney Adams, David Lewis, Sterling Barrett,
Michael Horgan, Peter Winston, Alyce Brady and many other people
that have given help or made comments.  If I've forgotten anyone
here, I hope you'll let me know.

Experts who have volunteered to build the database include Dave
Brooks, Jeremy Epstein, Richard Hesketh, Chris Rouch, and most of the
people mentioned above.

My additional thanks to the brave souls at the Harvard-Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory, Encore, the Media Lab, INEL, JPL, and the
other research sites that helped me figure out what was needed and
broken.

All the bugs, however, are mine.
