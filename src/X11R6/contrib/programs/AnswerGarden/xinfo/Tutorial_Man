USING THE MAN PAGES

The X routines are available as man pages under BSD and as help pages under
System V.

To obtain the man pages, type

	man XOpenDisplay

You should see the following.  (Note, additional tutorial follows this.)

	XOpenDisplay(3X11)  UNIX Programmer's Manual   XOpenDisplay(3X11)

	NAME
	     XOpenDisplay, XCloseDisplay - connect or disconnect to X
	     server

	SYNTAX
	     Display *XOpenDisplay(display_name)
        	   char *display_name;

	     XCloseDisplay(display)
	           Display *display;

	ARGUMENTS
	     display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

	     display_name
        	       Specifies the hardware display name, which deter-
	               mines the display and communications domain to be
        	       used.  On a POSIX system, if the display_name is
	               NULL, it defaults to the value of the DISPLAY
        	       environment variable.

	DESCRIPTION
	     The XOpenDisplay function returns a Display structure that
	     serves as the connection to the X server and that contains

and more.  (The end has been omitted to preserve your sanity.)

If the man page does not show up, you should contact your system administrator.

Often several routines are combined into one man page (XOpenDisplay and
XCloseDisplay in the above example).  If the man page for the routine does
not show up, you might want to try "apropos" or "man -k"

	apropos XCloseDisplay

or

	man -k XCloseDisplay

which returns:

% apropos XCloseDisplay
XOpenDisplay, XCloseDisplay (3X11)  - connect or disconnect to X server

and then you can do "man XOpenDisplay".

If no man pages for X show up, contact your system administrator.
