Here are some standard run-time problems, warnings, and errors,
along with what they mean:

X Protocol Errors

Protocol errors look like:

X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter) 
  Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC) 
  Minor opcode of failed request:  0 
  Resource id in failed request:  0x0 
  Serial number of failed request:  5 
  Current serial number in output stream:  7 

If you are programming, look at the field called "resource id".  If
the value is "0x0", then you are sending a null value to the server
in a protocol request.  

In Xt, the typical error is sending the value from an XtWindow
call before your program has performed an XtRealizeWidget.  Since
windows for widgets are created at the XtRealizeWidget time, a
widget will not have a valid window id until then.  Hence, you
will get the NULL value from an XtWindow call before the widget
is realized.

In the above case, this is exactly what occurred.  The window id provided
to XCreateGC (which requires a window or pixmap id) was NULL.

@begin(E)
If you get a message like:

  Warning: Actions not found: sett

it means that some widget does not support the action "sett".  

Usually, this results from having a typo in your resource file. 
You should check the widget set documentation for correct
spellings.  For example, the lines:

  AnswerGarden*Command.translations: #override \
	<BtnDown>:   sett() \n\
	<BtnUp>:     notify() unset()\n

are incorrect; the proper spelling of the action is "set".  To
determine this, you should look under the Command widget (in
the Athena widget set documentation).
