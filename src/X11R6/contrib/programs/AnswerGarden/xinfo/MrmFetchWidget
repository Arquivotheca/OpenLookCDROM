If you are using UIL, and your program foolishly calls MrmFetchWidget()
more than once, you are in trouble.

To a new user, it seems like the obvious way to find out the id of
his menu bar, or whatever. The consequence is that two instances will
exist, and he will manipulate one instance, with no effect on the
other.

This is mentioned in the manuals, but I'm not the only person who's
done it.
