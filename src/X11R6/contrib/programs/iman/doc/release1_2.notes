IMAN version 1.2
Copyright (c) 1994 Bruno RIVAS
June 1994



This document describes how to build, install and get started with
Release 1.2 of the IMAN package and gives a good overview of its
contents.


1.Brief Overview of the Distribution


IMAN Distribution 1.2 is made of three parts. It contains :


The IMAN Development Toolkit

    This toolkit, which is fully independent of any other toolkit
    like Xt or Athena, contains a set of widgets and a powerful API
    to manipulate them, to add items and to manage windows. It also
    introduces a short API to send orders to the brand-new help
    server joined in this package; on-line help can be integrated
    very easily in any application.

The IMAN Window Manager

    The window manager brings a Microsoft Windows-like desktop on
    your X server with an integrated clipboard manager, a task
    administrator, a color selector and many other useful utilities
    in one single program. Of course it fully manages X clients
    windows (groups, dialog box, dynamic properties setting,
    etc...), selection mechanisms, inter-clients messaging, etc...

 The IMAN Help Server

    This is the first version of the on-line help engine. It should
    display a contextual help for any client that requests it. It
    works with fully portable help files that contains text, colors,
    bitmaps, pixmaps and help topics. It's ASCII and you can modify
    it by hand. A binary file version should be supported for next
    release.




2. Structure of the Distribution

The IMAN Distribution comes with sources for various UNIX systems and
for DESQview/X. Files are organized into the following directories :


2.1 Sources

All sources should be included in the following directories.
Nevertheless, it is not mandatory :

/usr/src/iman/toolkit
    This directory contains sources and resources for the
    development kit. It must be built first if you plan to recompile
    the whole Distribution.

/usr/src/iman/wm
    This directory contains sources and resources for the window
    manager. Be sure the toolkit binaries and headers have been
    installed first.

/usr/src/iman/hs
    This directory contains sources and resources for the new help
    server. The development toolkit must be installed first. The
    directory '/usr/src/doc/phf' contains portable help files you
    can read and modify.

/usr/src/iman/doc
    This directory holds the documentation on IMAN with its API
    programming manual, the user guide, these release notes and
    other papers. It comes in ASCII, Postscript an EZ (Andrew).

/usr/src/iman/libfile
    This directory contains the sources for a small and portable
    (??) C library that handles file and directory functions :
    libMfile.a It is used by the HS, but you can use it too in your
    applications. An API documentation should come with the sources.


2.2 Binaries

/usr/bin/X11/iman
    This directory contains the WM and the HS binaries. It should be
    included into your PATH environment variable. It may contain
    some additional binary utilities.

/usr/lib
    This directory contains the IMAN development library libXiman.a.
    It also contains a new library used by the HS to manage files
    and directories: libMfile.a.

/usr/include/X11/iman
    This directory contains the IMAN headers to be included into
    your programs.

/usr/include/misc/file
    This directory contains the headers for the libMfile.a library.

/usr/lib/iman
    This directory contains all the IMAN resources and
    subdirectories (for help, the clipboard, etc...).

/usr/lib/iman/clipboard
    This directory contains all the screen shots you can take with
    the clipboard manager of the WM. Files are stored in XPM 3
    format, from Groupe BULL.

/usr/lib/iman/doc
    This directory contains all the documentation that comes with
    the distribution. It's a copy of /usr/src/iman/doc.

/usr/lib/iman/images/bm
/usr/lib/iman/images/xpm
    This directory contains various X bitmaps and XPM 3 files you
    can read with 'bitmap' or 'sxpm'.

/usr/lib/iman/help
    This directory contains all the help files. If you write one,
    you should put it into that directory since the HS looks here
    first for a help file.



3. Building the Release


3.1 Unpacking the Distribution

This Distribution normally comes as multiple compressed tar files,
usually on floppies. You must mount the device that holds them first.
Files need to be installed in there proper directories. To install them :

    % uncompress tar-file.Z
    % tar xfp tar-file


3.2 Setting some Platform Parameters

Support has only been added for some X servers and OS. The file
/usr/src/iman/toolkit/tk_os.h contains those definitions. Uncomment the
one that is closer to your OS; it should work on nearly any UNIX-like OS
with or without TCP/IP.

The file /usr/src/iman/wm/os.h also contains some specific declarations :

/*
#define HAS_SHAPE_EXTENSION_LIBRARY
#include <X11/extensions/shape.h>
*/
If you have the X Shape extension library, uncomment these lines. Else,
en error will occur at link time.

#define CLIPBOARD_SAVE_PATH "/usr/lib/iman/clipboard"
This declaration decides where the WM must write the XPM files when a
user takes some screen shots.

#define IMANRC_PATH "/"
This declaration helps the WM to find its resource file
($USER_PATH/.imanrc on UNIX systems, iman.rc on DESQview/X).


3.3 Typing "make all"

You can 'cd' to the /usr/src/iman directory and start the build with:

	% xmkmf
	% make all

You can redirect the output into a file but we advise you to watch the
build: it should not take more than 30 minutes for the development
toolkit and nearly as much for the WM and the HS. **WARNING**: the WM
and the HS need the libXpm.a library version 3.0 or upper, and the HS
also need the libMfile.a library that comes with this package. 
If something goes wrong, try again (type "make everything" or "make all"
again) once you have corrected the problem.

If you only want to re-build one component of the distribution you can
type one of the following:

            % xmkmf
    % make toolkit
    % make wm
    % make hs


3.4 Installing the Distribution

Once you have built what you wanted to, you must install it in the good
directories. Type:

    % make install

You can type it from /usr/src/iman or one of its subdirectories; only
what is in the subdirectory will be installed.



4. Getting the software


The IMAN Distribution 1.2 is a fast growing project. It should be
available with X11R6 by June 1994, if everything goes fine with the X
Consortium. I suppose that IMAN will then appear in a number of UNIX
packages, which would be a good thing.

You also can FTP it on the Internet at this adress :

Institut Blaise Pascal, Paris, FRANCE
ftp.ibp.fr : /pub/iman	(132.227.60.2)
