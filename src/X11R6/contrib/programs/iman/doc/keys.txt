Here are some useful shortcuts to manage the IMAN window manager :



Double-click (Button 1) or CTL+ESC : maps the Process Panel to handle
windows and X clients.

Double-click (Button 2) or ALT+ESC : maps the Desktop Panel to manage
colors, decoration, save-screen, etc...

Double-click (Button 3) or SHIFT+ESC : maps the Options Panel to handle
icons and set some parameters.

CTL+ALT+ESC : kills an X process

CTL+ALT+END : ends the IMAN window manager, free memory and closes
resources files.

CTL+SHIFT+PrintScreen : displays the Clipboard window (it only works on
some UNIX systems).

SHIFT+PrintScreen : makes a hardcopy of a window. It doesn't copy the
window decoration.

CTL+PrintScreen : makes a hardcopy of a window and its decoration.

PrintScreen : makes a screen shot of the whole screen.

ALT+W : writes the screen shot in a XPM3 file (the Clipboard window must
have the focus to make this operation).
