	Modified so that it works on B&W as well as color displays.

	Changed 'stop' and 'go' cards to be labeled.

	Fixed roll.c to work on Suns.

	Modified cardlib so the makfile would work properly on Suns,
	which have a new feature (by at least OS 3.3) that builds
	foo if foo.c exists.  therefore rules of the form:
		ace.o:	ace ace_mask ace.c
	which should create ace.o from ace.c, which includes ace and 
	ace_mask, first builds ace from ace.c (with cc -o ace ace.c).
	this of course trashes the ace bitmap. solution was to name 
	change all the bitmap files so there wouldn't be a corresponding
	.c file.  there may be an easier way, but i don't know it.

	Animated mode no longer works correctly.

	The X10 fonts timrom12 and timrom12b are used, and their .bdf
	files are included.
