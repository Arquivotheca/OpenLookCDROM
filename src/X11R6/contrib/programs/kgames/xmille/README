Notes on porting xmille:

	The bitmaps in 'cards' are set up for color and monochrome displays,
using a gray stipple in monochrome to make the cards readable.

	You may also find the widgets included in xmille to be of general
use; in particular, the Layout widget accepts TeX-esque descriptions of
widget geometrys and dynamically adapts to widget resize requests and
window geometry changes.  No documentation for these widgets exists yet.

	I'll cheerfully accept bug reports in xmille, and may even be
willing to maintain a current version; but as with the first version, I wash
my hands of this mess by putting it into the public domain, I don't care
what you do with it.
