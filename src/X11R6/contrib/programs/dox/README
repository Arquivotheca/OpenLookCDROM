The dox program is a shell command-line interface to Xlib functions;
it can be used to create (very) simple script-based X applications.

In addition to the dox source code and manual page, there are four scripts:
	try.sh		exercises all Xlib functions callable by dox
	xshev.sh	ksh-script-based version of contributed xev program
	xshkill.sh	script-based version of standard xkill program
	xshlogo.sh	ksh-script-based version of standard xlogo program
These are intended as examples only and are not installed by the Imakefile.

The program has been tested on a Sun 4/75 running SunOS 4.1.1; it was compiled
with both Sun's C compiler and GCC 2.5.8.
