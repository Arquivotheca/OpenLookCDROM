Systems with no usleep() call should compile Dclock.c with -DNO_USLEEP.

When the program is running and the mouse is in the window, you can
type the following keys:
    
    r -- toggle reverse video
    s -- toggle seconds display
    b -- toggle the bell to ring on half hours
    j -- toggle jump or smooth scrolling
    d -- toggle date string display
    m -- toggle military (24hr) time format
    a -- toggle the alarm clock
    f -- toggle fade
    l -- toggle language (french/english)
    q -- quit

To set the alarm time, use the third mouse button and click on the
digits till the time is set correctly.  Alarm time is set in 24-hour
format to distringuish between am and pm.  If there is an asterisk
on the same line as the date, then the alarm is set.  Use the 'a' key
to set the alarm.

Sun workstations can set the resources, *Dclock.hours_snd and
*Dclock.half_hours_snd, to a file containing sun audio format,
which is sent to /dev/audio on the hour and half-hour.  Or,
you can use the command line args: -hours_snd and -half_hours_snd
with audio file filenames as the following parameters.

Examples:

    # set alarm for noon
    dclock -fg green -gb black -alarmTime 12:00 -alarm

    # set date string and have bell go off on hour/half-hour intervals
    dclock -date "Today is %W, %M %d" -fg yellow -bg brown -bell

    # set date more simply, use 24-hour military time format and display secs
    dclock -date "%w, %m %d" -miltime -seconds
