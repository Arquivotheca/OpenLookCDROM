  /* The above definitions specify the error codes passed to a DPSErrorProc:

       dps_err_ps identifies standard PostScript language interpreter
       errors. The arg1 argument to the errorProc is the address of the
       binary object sequence sent by the handleerror (or resynchandleerror)
       operator to report the error. The sequence has 1 object, which is an
       array of 4 objects. See the language extensions document for details
       on the contents of this sequence. arg2 is the number of bytes in the
       entire binary object sequence.

       dps_err_nameTooLong flags user names that are too long. 128 chars
       is the maximum length for PostScript language names. The name and its
       length are passed as arg1 and arg2 to the error proc.

       dps_err_resultTagCheck flags erroneous result tags, most likely
       due to erroneous explicit use of the printobject operator. The
       pointer to the binary object sequence and its length are passed
       as arg1 and arg2 to the error proc. There is one object in the
       sequence.

       dps_err_resultTypeCheck flags incompatible result types. A pointer
       to the offending binary object is passed as arg1; arg2 is unused.

       dps_err_invalidContext flags an invalid DPSContext argument. An
       attempt to send PostScript language code to a context that has
       terminated is the most likely cause of this error. arg1 to the
       DPSErrorProc is the context id (see the fork operator); arg2 is
       unused.

       dps_err_invalidAccess flags an attempt to access a context in
       a way that it does not support.  An example is waiting for return
       values on a text context.

  /* A sample DPSErrorProc for handling errors from the PostScript interpreter.
     The meaning of arg1 and arg2 depend on 'errorCode'. See DPSErrorCode,
     above.

     DPSDefaultErrorProc formulates a text message and passes it to the
     text backstop proc (see DPSSetTextBackstop).
     
     If errorCode == dps_err_ps AND the application had previously caused
     resyncstart to be executed by ctxt, DPSDefaultErrorProc calls
     RAISE(dps_err_ps, ctxt) after invoking the text backstop proc.
     DPSDefaultErrorProc is the only procedure in the Display PostScript
     library that calls RAISE, and it calls RAISE only in the case outlined
     above.
     
     When DPSDefaultErrorProc is used as a context's errorProc, the exception
     to report dps_err_ps can be raised by any of the procedures in the Display
     PostScript library, even ones invoked to deal with other contexts. Note
     therefore that wraps might raise this exception. Applications that use
     resyncstart must be prepared to handle exceptions. 
     
     See DPSResetContext for details on what to do when an exception to
     report dps_err_ps is raised.
