/***************************************************************
**
** This header file is used in conjuction with the parseAFM.c file.
** Together these files provide the functionality to parse Adobe Font
** Metrics files and store the information in predefined data structures.
** It is intended to work with an application program that needs font metric
** information. The program can be used as is by making a procedure call to 
** parse an AFM file and have the data stored, or an application developer
** may wish to customize the code. 
**
** This header file defines the data structures used as well as the key 
** strings that are currently recognized by this version of the AFM parser.
** This program is based on the document "Adobe Font Metrics Files, 
** Specification Version 2.0".
**
** AFM files are separated into distinct sections of different data. Because
** of this, the parseAFM program can parse a specified file to only save
** certain sections of information based on the application's needs. A record 
** containing the requested information will be returned to the application.
** 
** AFM files are divided into five sections of data:
**	1) The Global Font Information
**	2) The Character Metrics Information 
**	3) The Track Kerning Data
**	4) The Pair-Wise Kerning Data
**	5) The Composite Character Data
**
** Basically, the application can request any of these sections independent
** of what other sections are requested. In addition, in recognizing that
** many applications will want ONLY the x-width of characters and not all
** of the other character metrics information, there is a way to receive
** only the width information so as not to pay the storage cost for the 
** unwanted data. An application should never request both the 
** "quick and dirty" char metrics (widths only) and the Character Metrics 
** Information since the Character Metrics Information will contain all 
** of the character widths as well.
** 
** There is a procedure in parseAFM.c, called parseFile, that can be 
** called from any application wishing to get information from the AFM File.
** This procedure expects 3 parameters: a vaild file descriptor, a pointer
** to a (AFMFontInfo *) variable (for which space will be allocated and then 
** will be filled in with the data requested), and a mask specifying
** which data from the AFM File should be saved in the AFMFontInfo structure.
** 
** The flags that can be used to set the appropriate mask are defined below.
** In addition, several commonly used masks have already been defined. 
**
