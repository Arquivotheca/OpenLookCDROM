To run texteroids, just type
	texteroids "string to display"
If the string has no spaces, the quotes may be skipped.  Texteroids
recognizes the command line options -fn to set the font and -size to
set the size.  Once the program is running, try to click on the word
and then the letters with the mouse.

Texteroids demonstrates
	- using a pixmap to achieve double buffering for flicker-free
	  animation
	- transforming X coordinates from the mouse events to PS
	  coordinates
	- getting character bounding box information from DPS
	- synchronizing between the application and the server to ensure
	  that the mouse events are for the current screen configuration
	- writing wraps that return arrays of values
	- changing the DPS context to different X drawables (in this
	  case, pixmaps)
