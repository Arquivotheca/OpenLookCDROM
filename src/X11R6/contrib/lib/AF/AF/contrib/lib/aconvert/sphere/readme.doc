                             Release 1.5 (beta)
                                 April 1990


0. Introduction:

SPHERE is a software package containing:
    1. a set of C functions that can be used to:
        a) create and modify NIST speech file headers (in memory)
        b) read (write) NIST speech file headers from (to) disk
    2. a set of basic utility programs that use the functions

This software has been developed for use within the DARPA speech research
community.  Although care has been taken to ensure that all software is
complete and bug-free, it is made available to the speech research
community without endorsement or express or implied warranties.  



1. Usage:

User programs are linked with the library libsp.a, which contains
the C functions mentioned above and some other functions that are
used to support them. Functions that begin with "sp_" are intended
to be callable by user programs. The semantics of the functions
in this library are described in comments in the source code and
are also collected at the end of this document.

All functions in the library that return pointers will return NULL
pointers on failure/error. All numeric functions will return negative
values on failure/error.

User programs that call the functions should "#include" the files
header.h and sp.h. The former contains, among other things, some
type definitions used by the library functions. The latter contains
declarations for all user functions in the library.



2. Installation:

To install SPHERE on a Unix system, use the Unix utility "make".
While in the directory where the package source code has been
installed, type:

	make -f makefile.

The speech header library will be created, as well as the sample
programs. Installation on non-Unix systems without "make" will
probably require manual compilation.



3. Sample Programs:

Several sample programs have been included in this release to
demonstrate the functionality of the SPHERE header library:

	h_read [options] [file ...]
		reads headers from the files listed on the
		command line; by default, output is lines of
		tuples consisting of all fieldnames and values;
		many options modify the program's behavior; see
		the manual page "h_read.1"

	h_add inputfile outputfile
		adds a header to the data in inputfile, stores
		the result in outputfile

	h_strip inputfile outputfile
		strips the header from inputfile, stores the
		remaining data in outputfile; if outputfile
		is "-", writes the sample data to stdout

	h_test
		tests the header routines through an endless
		loop that stores and retrieves values from a header;
		Bugs in the library would hopefully either result
		in an insertion/retrieval error or a memory allocation
		error/failure

	Newer tools:
		h_edit
			edit header fields
		h_nlrm
			remove newline characters from fields
		h_delete
			delete header fields

The abstract data type that programs use is a pointer to a "header_t"
structure. This pointer is a handle used by the functions that operate
on the header, much like a FILE pointer is used as a handle by functions
in the C "stdio" library that operate on files.

One difference is that there are two different ways to return a
header pointer to a user program. The first method is to call the
function that returns a pointer to an empty header. The second
reads the fields from a speech file into a header.

Another difference is that there is no set limit on the number of
headers a program can have existing in memory at a given time.
The C "stdio" library typically limits the number of open files
to 20 or so, because the actual array of FILE structures is declared
statically. Header structures are allocated dynamically, so user
programs should deallocate headers that are no longer in use to
avoid running out of memory.
