NAME
     h_read - scan NIST SPHERE-format '.wav' file

SYNOPSIS
     h_read [options] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The command h_read reads the headers  of  the  '.wav'  files
     specified  on  the  command line and, by default, prints the
     names and values of all header fields one-per-line.  Various
     options alter the behavior of the program.

OPTIONS
     -f h print filename (between ":::::"  strings)  before  pro-
          cessing every file

     -f a print filename with every field

     -n   suppress printing of fieldnames

     -t   print field types (i, r, or s) with field values

     -d   suppress printing of field values

     -N f number fields printed on per-file basis

     -N t number fields printed on per-run basis

     -S   restrict field output to standard NIST fields

     -F fieldname
          restrict field output to explicitly-named fields

     -c   complement field name selection test

     -s string
          delimit components of field lines by string [one blank]

     -a   check for odd characters in string fields (by  default,
          odd characters are non-printable characters)

     -o string
          characters in string are added to the list  of  charac-
          ters to be considered not odd

     -V   verify that the number of bytes in each file is correct
          based on the fields sample_count and sample_n_bytes

     -e n verify that the number of fields in each file is n

     -B n separate output for different files by  n  blank  lines
          [0]

     -T string
          restrict output to fields of type integer, real, and/or
          string as specified by characters i, r, and s in string
          [irs]

     -v   select verbose output

     -q   print field values between quotes

     -0   number fields starting at 0 [1]

          Options -F and -S cannot both be  specified.   No  more
          than one -o option may be specified.

EXIT STATUS
     Exit status is 0 if no errors occur in processing the entire
     set of files.  Otherwise, the exit status is non-zero.
