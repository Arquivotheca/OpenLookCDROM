radio_mcast.c - a program to multicast audio data on an ethernet using the
Ultrix packetfiler

To use:
arecord | radio_mcast

radio_recv.c - a program to receive multicast'ed audio data using the
Ultrix packetfilter

The output from radio_recv should be piped in to aplay or xplay.
e.g.
radio_recv | aplay
or
radio_recv | xplay -file -

radio_recv should be installed setuid root, radio_mcast should be run
as root (though I guess you could install it setuid as well, but
there is a security risk to that).

To use these programs, your Ultrix kernel must be configured with
the packetfilter on.
