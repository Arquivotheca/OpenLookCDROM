File: .../server/dia/BuiltInAtoms

This file is of a fixed format and is used to generate both the file
include/AAtom.h and dia/initatoms.c. Neither of those files should be
edited directly. Changing the atoms in this file, or even the order in
which they occur, is equivalent to forcing a new (minor) version number
on the server. Take care.

The format of the file is that each built in atom starts in column 1
with no text, other than spaces and tabs, on that line other than a
mandatory trailing "@" at the end of the line. For each atom (Foo)
below the defines will be of the form
	#define AA_Foo <n>
and the string value of the atom will be "Foo".

The comment lines in this file are not guaranteed to be accurate. To see the
current truth, look at the Xlib documentation as well as the protocol spec.
