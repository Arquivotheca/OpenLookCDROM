We have written a fairly lengthy <A

report</A> on the design principles behind AF, the protocol, client 
library, server, and performance.

A shorter, but less detailed introduction to AudioFile (AF2R2) can be found

paper</A> presented at the Summer 93 USENIX.  The accompanying PostScript 
slides are <A HREF="docs/af-usenix-93.ps">here</A>. <P>
