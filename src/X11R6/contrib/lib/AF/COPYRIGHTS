Software in this distribution of the AudioFile Audio Server is covered 
by copyrights.  Please read and understand this document.

Parts of the AudioFile server are derived from MIT X Consortium sources,
and therefore preserve MIT copyrights.

The base AudioFile server, device dependent audio code, client library,
and basic applications carry an X Consortium style copyright which permits
unlimited commercial and non-commercial use.  A sample is directly below.

Copyrights from contributed code are included below.

In order to contribute software to the AudioFile distribution, we suggest 
following the model of the X Window System. The following is the guide 
lines from that distribution.  Other terms will make it unlikely that we 
will include a contribution on subsequent releases; we do not wish to spend 
our time with lawyers on a case by case basis.

----------------------------------
The MIT distribution of the X Window System is publicly available, but is NOT
in the public domain.  The difference is that copyrights granting rights for
unrestricted use and redistribution have been placed on all of the software to
identify its authors.  You are allowed and encouraged to take this software and
build commerical products.

Individuals or organizations wishing to contribute software to the public
releases should use a copyright notice that is no more restrictive than 
the sample given below.  In particular, 

     o  Do not place any restictions on what can be done with this software
	(this includes using the GNU "copyleft").

     o  Do not include the words "All rights reserved" unless you have had a 
	lawyer verify that you have also explicitly given away all of the 
	necessary rights shown in the samples.

     o  Spell out the word "Copyright"; the phrase "(c)" is NOT a legal
	alternative to the c-in-circle symbol.

     o  Put at least a one-line copyright at the top of EVERY source file, if
	not the full copyright.  Also, the copyright line or full notice MUST
	physically appear in each file.  Using the preprocessor to #include the
	copyright from some other file has no legal meaning (it can be used to
	incorporate common strings into the binary, but has no effect on the
	status of the source code).

     o  Things that are copyrighted are, by definition, not in the public
	domain.

A copyright notice similar to the following is strongly recommended (replacing
MIT with your organization's name and putting your name and address at the
bottom).
