This files describes some of the bba (DS5000/25 base board audio)
files in this hierarchy.

  mips.src/	Driver sources specific to Ultrix/RISC
	bba.c	driver source

  mips.kit/	Filled by `make update' with driver sources for Ultrix/RISC
		from ./ and from ./mips.src.  This is the directory
		used to create and hold the setld kit.
	output/	Directory which holds the setld kit for Ultrix/RISC

To rebuild a setld kit (in the master pool only) for Ultrix/RISC MIPS
follow these steps.
 
	% cd <audio_root>/devices/bba/driver
	% make update
	% cd mips.kit/data
	% /sys/dist/newinv BBA100.mi ../src
		Edit files as appropriate in order to build master
		inventory (see man pages.)
	% /sys/dist/kits BBA100.k ../src ../output
