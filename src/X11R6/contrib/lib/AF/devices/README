The definitions in ./devices/Makefile.rules.example should be used as a 
template to create ./devices/Makefile.rules. The parameter definitions at 
the top of this file should be customized for your site. The list of these 
parameters is included below along with a description of its use.

	% cd <audio_root>/devices
	% cp Makefile.rules.example Makefile.rules

The default parameters used by ./Makefile.rules are:

BINDIR This is the installation directory for binary programs. The template 
	file uses the command, /bin/machine to create an architecturally 
	specific suffix (typically alpha or mips.)

MANDIR This is used to specify the location where manual pages are to be 
	installed. The man pages will be installed in the man{1-8} 
	subdirectories of MANDIR.

USRLIBDIR This is the installation directory for libraries. The template 
	file uses the command, /bin/machine to create an architecturally 
	specific suffix (typically alpha or mips.)

INCDIR Header files will be installed in this location.

LODDIR DSP56001 lodfiles will be installed in this location. Typically, the 
	audio servers for LoFi and J-Video will look here for the image 
	necessary for loading onto the hardware during initialization.

DOCDIR Miscellaneous PostScript and ASCII text documents are placed in this 
	directory for easy access.

SCRIPTDIR This is a repository for script files for the LoFi diagnostic 
	program, hwddt.

You should modify the macros described above to be consistent with your 
changes to the file, <audio_root>/AF/config/site.def.
