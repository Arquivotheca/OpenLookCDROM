To install the base board driver on Alpha AXP OSF/1 workstations,
as root,

	# cd <audio_root>/devices/axp/driver/alpha.kit/output
	# setld -l .

This will take you through the steps of reconfiguring your kernel
with base board audio driver support.  Reboot after copying
the newly built kernel to /vmunix.  Upon reboot,

	# strsetup -ic

and you should be able to run the Aaxp server and AF clients.
