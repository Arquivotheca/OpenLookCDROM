This files describes some of the LoFi (aka DECaudio) files in this hierarchy.

  alpha.src/	Driver sources specific to OSF/1 Alpha.
	lofi.c	driver source
  	lofi.7	driver man page, includes installation information

  mips.src/	Driver sources specific to Ultrix/RISC
	lofi.c	driver source
	lofi.4	driver man page, includes installation information

  alpha.kit/	Filled by `make update' with driver sources for OSF/1 Alpha
		from ./ and from ./alpha.src.  This is the directory
		used to create and hold the setld kit.
	output/	Directory which holds the setld kit for OSF/1 Alpha.

To rebuild a setld kit (in the master pool only) for OSF/1 Alpha 
follow these steps (you need not be root to do this.)

	% cd <audio_root>/devices/lofi/driver
	% make update
	% cd alpha.kit/data
	% newinv LFI100.mi ../src
		Edit files as appropriate in order to build master
		inventory (see man pages.)
	% kits LFI100.k ../src ../output
