NAME
  aecho	- An AF	play/record client.

SYNOPSIS
  <B>aecho</B>	[<B>-d</B> <I>device</I>]

DESCRIPTION
  <I>aecho</I>	reads samples from stdin and sends the sound data to the audio server
  for playback.	It simultaneously records, with	the record data	sent to
  stdout.  The play and	record operations are synchronized (i.e. the audio
  time of the first playback sample is the audio time of the first record
  sample).

  <I>aecho</I>	is useful for experimenting with room acoustics, and debugging audio
  hardware.

OPTIONS

  <B>-d</B> <I>device</I>

       Specifies which audio device to use for playback	and recording.	If
       <I>device</I> is not specified,	<I>aecho</I> defaults to the first device that	isn't
       connected to the	telephone.

ENVIRONMENT

  <B>AUDIOFILE</B>	 specifies the host and	server to use.

BUGS
  There	is no way to play back a file in preempt mode.

  If you encounter a <B>reproducible</B> bug, please submit a problem report to
  (af-bugs@crl.dec.com).
