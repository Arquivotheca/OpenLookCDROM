NAME
  AF - a network-transparent audio server and client library for networked
  audio	devices.

SYNOPSIS

  The AF audio server is a network transparent	system developed at Digital
  CRL for using	LoFi audio hardware in a distributed environment.

CONNECTION NAME

  From the user's prospective, every AF	server has an <I>audio</I> <I>connection</I> of the
  form:

			      <I>hostname</I>:<I>portOffset</I>

  This information is used by the application to determine how it should con-
  nect to the server.

  <I>hostname</I>
	  The <I>hostname</I> specifies the name of the machine to which the audio
	  device is physically connected.

  <I>portOffset</I>
	  The <I>portOffset</I> is used to identify the audio server's	port on	<I>host-</I>
	  <I>name</I>.	 For example, to run multiple audio servers on a given host
	  simultaneously, you need to select a unique <I>portOffset</I> for each
	  invocation of	an audio server.

  If the connection name to an audio server is not specified, then the
  environment variables	<I>AUDIOFILE</I> or <I>DISPLAY</I> will be used.

ACCESS CONTROL
  The sample server provides two types of access control:  an authorization
  protocol which provides a list of ``magic cookies'' clients can send to
  request access, and a	list of	hosts from which connections are always
  accepted.

BUGS
  If you encounter a <B>repeatable</B>	bug, please submit a problem report to () and
  include the source code if possible.

  What you do with applications	you develop is your buisness; if you wish to
  contribute code to this distribution see below.

  In order to contribute software to the AF distribution, we suggest follow-
  ing the model	of the X Window	System.	 The following is the guide lines
  from that distribution.  Other terms will make it unlikely that we will
  include a contribution on subsequent releases; we do not wish	to spend our
  time with lawyers on a case by case basis.

  The MIT distribution of the X	Window System is publicly available, but is
  NOT in the public domain.  The difference is that copyrights granting
  rights for unrestricted use and redistribution have been placed on all of
  the software to identify its authors.	 You are allowed and encouraged	to
  take this software and build commerical products.

  Individuals or organizations wishing to contribute software to the public
  releases should use a	copyright notice that is no more restrictive than the
  sample given below.  In particular,

  <B>o</B>	  Do not place any restictions on what can be done with	this software

  <B>o</B>	  Do not include the words "All	rights reserved" unless	you have had
	  a lawyer verify that you have	also explicitly	given away all of the
	  necessary rights shown in the	samples.

  <B>o</B>	  Spell	out the	word "Copyright"; the phrase "(c)" is NOT a legal
	  alternative to the c-in-circle symbol.

  <B>o</B>	  Put at least a one-line copyright at the top of EVERY	source file,
	  if not the full copyright.  Also, the	copyright line or full notice
	  MUST physically appear in each file.	Using the preprocessor to
	  #include the copyright from some other file has no legal meaning
	  (it can be used to incorporate common	strings	into the binary, but
	  has no effect	on the status of the source code).

  <B>o</B>	  Things that are copyrighted are, by definition, not in the public
