NAME
  makedepend - create dependencies in makefiles

SYNOPSIS
  <B>makedepend</B> [ <B>-Dname=def</B> ] [ <B>-Dname</B> ] [ <B>-Iincludedir</B> ]	[ <B>-fmakefile</B> ] [
  <B>-oobjsuffix</B> ]	[ <B>-sstring</B> ] [ <B>-wwidth</B> ] [ - - <B>otheroptions</B> - -	] sourcefile
  ...

DESCRIPTION
  <B>Makedepend</B> reads each	<I>sourcefile</I> in sequence and parses it like a C-
  preprocessor,	processing all #<I>include</I>, #<I>define</I>, #<I>undef</I>, #<I>ifdef</I>, #<I>ifndef</I>,
  #<I>endif</I>, #<I>if</I> and #<I>else</I>	directives so that it can correctly tell which
  #<I>include</I>, directives would be	used in	a compilation.	Any #<I>include</I>, direc-
  tives	can reference files having other #<I>include</I> directives, and parsing
  will occur in	these files as well.

  Every	file that a <I>sourcefile</I> includes, directly or indirectly, is what <B>mak-</B>
  <B>edepend</B> calls	a "dependency".	 These dependencies are	then written to	a
  <I>makefile</I> in such a way that <B><A HREF="../man1/make.html">make(1)</A></B> will know	which object files must	be
  recompiled when a dependency has changed.

  By default, <B>makedepend</B> places	its output in the file named <I>makefile</I> if it
  exists, otherwise <I>Makefile</I>. An alternate makefile may	be specified with the
  -<I>f</I> option.  It first searches	the makefile for the line

      #	DO NOT DELETE THIS LINE	-- make	depend depends on it.

  or one provided with the -<I>s</I> option, as a delimiter for the dependency	out-
  put.	If it finds it,	it will	delete everything following this to the	end
  of the makefile and put the output after this	line.  If it doesn't find it,
  the program will append the string to	the end	of the makefile	and place the
  output following that.  For each <I>sourcefile</I> appearing	on the command line,
  <B>makedepend</B> puts lines	in the makefile	of the form

       sourcefile.o: dfile ...

  Where	"sourcefile.o" is the name from	the command line with its suffix
  replaced with	".o", and "dfile" is a dependency discovered in	a #<I>include</I>
  directive while parsing <I>sourcefile</I> or	one of the files it included.

EXAMPLE
  Normally, <B>makedepend</B> will be used in a makefile target so that typing	"make
  depend" will bring the dependencies up to date for the makefile.  For	exam-
  ple,
      SRCS = file1.c file2.c ...
      CFLAGS = -O -DHACK -I../foobar -xyz
      depend:
	      makedepend -- $(CFLAGS) -- $(SRCS)

OPTIONS
  <B>Makedepend</B> will ignore any option that it does not understand	so that	you
  may use the same arguments that you would for	<B><A HREF="../man1/cc.html">cc(1)</A>.</B>

  <B>-Dname=def</B> <B>or</B>	<B>-Dname</B>
       Define.	This places a definition for <I>name</I> in <B>makedepend's</B> symbol
       table.  Without =<I>def</I> the	symbol becomes defined as "1".

  <B>-Iincludedir</B>
       Include directory.  This	option tells <B>makedepend</B>	to prepend <I>includedir</I>
       to its list of directories to search when it encounters a #<I>include</I>
       directive.  By default, <B>makedepend</B> only searches	/usr/include.

  <B>-fmakefile</B>
       Filename.  This allows you to specify an	alternate makefile in which
       <B>makedepend</B> can place its	output.

  <B>-oobjsuffix</B>
       Object file suffix.  Some systems may have object files whose suffix
       is something other than ".o".  This option allows you to	specify
       another suffix, such as ".b" with -<I>o</I>.<I>b</I> or ":obj"	with -<I>o</I>:<I>obj</I> and	so
       forth.

  <B>-sstring</B>
       Starting	string delimiter.  This	option permits you to specify a	dif-
       ferent string for <B>makedepend</B> to look for	in the makefile.

  <B>-wwidth</B>
       Line width.  Normally, <B>makedepend</B> will ensure that every	output line
       that it writes will be no wider than 78 characters for the sake of
       readability.  This option enables you to	change this width.

  <B>-</B> <B>-</B> <B>options</B> <B>-</B>	<B>-</B>
       If <B>makedepend</B> encounters	a double hyphen	(- -) in the argument list,
       then any	unrecognized argument following	it will	be silently ignored;
       a second	double hyphen terminates this special treatment.  In this
       way, <B>makedepend</B> can be made to safely ignore esoteric compiler argu-
       ments that might	normally be found in a CFLAGS <B>make</B> macro (see the
       <B>EXAMPLE</B> section above).	All options that <B>makedepend</B> recognizes and
       appear between the pair of double hyphens are processed normally.

ALGORITHM
  The approach used in this program enables it to run an order of magnitude
  faster than any other	"dependency generator" I have ever seen.  Central to
  this performance are two assumptions:	that all files compiled	by a single
  makefile will	be compiled with roughly the same -<I>I</I> and -<I>D</I> options; and that
  most files in	a single directory will	include	largely	the same files.

  Given	these assumptions, <B>makedepend</B> expects to be called once	for each
  makefile, with all source files that are maintained by the makefile appear-
  ing on the command line.  It parses each source and include file exactly
  once,	maintaining an internal	symbol table for each.	Thus, the first	file
  on the command line will take	an amount of time proportional to the amount
  of time that a normal	C preprocessor takes.  But on subsequent files,	if it
  encounter's an include file that it has already parsed, it does not parse
  it again.

  For example, imagine you are compiling two files, <I>file1</I>.<I>c</I> and	<I>file2</I>.<I>c</I>, they
  each include the header file <I>header</I>.<I>h</I>, and the file <I>header</I>.<I>h</I> in turn
  includes the files <I>def1</I>.<I>h</I> and	<I>def2</I>.<I>h</I>.	When you run the command

      makedepend file1.c file2.c

  <B>makedepend</B> will parse	<I>file1</I>.<I>c</I>	and consequently, <I>header</I>.<I>h</I> and then <I>def1</I>.<I>h</I>
  and <I>def2</I>.<I>h</I>. It then decides that the dependencies for	this file are

      file1.o: header.h	def1.h def2.h

  But when the program parses <I>file2</I>.<I>c</I> and discovers that it, too, includes
  <I>header</I>.<I>h</I>, it does not	parse the file,	but simply adds	<I>header</I>.<I>h</I>, <I>def1</I>.<I>h</I> and
  <I>def2</I>.<I>h</I> to the	list of	dependencies for <I>file2</I>.<I>o</I>.

BUGS
  If you do not	have the source	for cpp, the Berkeley C	preprocessor, then
  <B>makedepend</B> will be compiled in such a	way that all #<I>if</I> directives will
  evaluate to "true" regardless	of their actual	value.	This may cause the
  wrong	#<I>include</I> directives to be evaluated.  <B>Makedepend</B> should	simply have
  its own parser written for #<I>if</I> expressions.

  Imagine you are parsing two files, say <I>file1</I>.<I>c</I> and <I>file2</I>.<I>c</I>, each includes
  the file <I>def</I>.<I>h</I>. The list of files that <I>def</I>.<I>h</I> includes	might truly be dif-
  ferent when <I>def</I>.<I>h</I> is included	by <I>file1</I>.<I>c</I> than	when it	is included by
  <I>file2</I>.<I>c</I>. But once <B>makedepend</B> arrives at a list of dependencies for a file,
  it is	cast in	concrete.
