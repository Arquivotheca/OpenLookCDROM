Description

  <I>afft</I> accepts mu-law audio data from one of several sources, executes a run-
  ning Fourier transform on the	data, and displays the transform result.  The
  display is updated continuously in either "waterfall"	or "spectrogram" for-
  mat.

  <I>afft</I> is initially configured through command line switches.  Many of the
  parameters can be changed while the progogram	is running via the graphical
  user interface, as described below.

  The source of	the audio that is displayed depends on the configuration as
  folows: If the <B>-file</B> switch is given,	then the audio source is a file	of
  mu-law samples.  Otherwise, if the <B>-sine</B> switch is given, the	audio source
  is a "canned"	sine wave that sweeps up and down the frequency	spectrum.  If
  neither <B>-file</B>	or <B>-sine</B> are given, then <I>afft</I> takes its	audio data from	the
  audio	server local input.

Options

  <B>-color</B>

       Specifies that the display is to	be in color.  The default is grays-
       cale.  The color	scheme can be changed while <I>afft</I> is running by means
       of a pull-down menu labeled "<I>Colors</I>".

  <B>-d</B> <I>device</I>

       Specifies the name of the audio device.	If not given, <I>afft</I> defaults
       to the local audio device.

  <B>-file</B>	<I>file</I>

       Input will be taken from	<I>file</I>, which should contain raw mu-law samples
       of audio	data.  <I>afft</I> will continuously loop through the file from
       beginning to end, rewind	the file, and repeat.  If <I>file</I> is given	as
       "-", input is taken from	stdin.	Since it is not	possible to rewind
       stdin, <I>afft</I> will	terminate on end-of-file in this case.

       If <I>afft</I> can connect to the audio	server,	then the file is played
       through the audio output	device in synchronization with the fft
       display.

  <B>-gain</B>	<I>gainvalue</I>

       Sets the	gain in	DB to be applied to the	audio samples.	Should be in
       the range of -100 to -5,	and represents a level down from a theoreti-
       cal peak	value of 0DB.  Applies only when log mode is selected, see
       <B>-log</B> switch.  Default value is -20.  The	gain value may be controlled
       while <I>afft</I> is running by	a slider labeled "<I>Gain</I>".

  <B>-length</B> <I>fftlength</I>

       Sets the	number of samples over which each FFT transform	is computed.
       Legal values are	512, 256, 128, and 64.	Default	value is 512.  The
       length can be changed while <I>afft</I>	is running by means of a pull-down
       menu labeled "<I>FFT</I> <I>Length</I>"

  <B>-log</B>

       Selects the initial display mode	to be logarithmic.  If not specified,
       the initial display mode	is linear.  The	selection between log and
       linear mode may be changed while	<I>afft</I> is	running	by a pair of radio
       buttons labeled "<I>Log</I>" and "<I>Linear</I>".

  <B>-min</B> <I>minvalue</I>

       Sets the	lowest audio level that	will be	displayed.  Value is in	DB
       for log mode, or	in percent of peak value in linear mode.  Default is
       -100 in log mode, and 0 in linear.  The minimum value may be con-
       trolled while <I>afft</I> is running by	a slider labeled "<I>Minimum</I>".

  <B>-max</B> <I>maxvalue</I>

       Sets the	hightest audio level that will be displayed.  Value is in DB
       for log mode, or	in percent of peak value in linear mode.  Default is
       0 in log	mode, and  100 in linear.  The maximum value may be con-
       trolled while <I>afft</I> is running by	a slider labeled "<I>Maximum</I>".

  <B>-nodc</B>

       Supresses display of the	DC component.  Default is to include the DC
       component in the	fft display.  Inclusion	or supression of the DC	com-
       ponent may be changed while <I>afft</I>	is running by a	pair of	radio buttons
       labeled "<I>NoDC</I>" and "<I>DC</I>".

  <B>-noscope</B>

       Suppresses display of the audio stream in an oscilloscope-like form.
       The default is to show this display.  Oscilloscope display can also be
       turned on and off while <I>afft</I> is running by a pair of radio buttons
       labeled "<I>Scope</I> <I>On</I>" and "<I>Scope</I> <I>Off</I>".

  <B>-nowindow</B>

       Supresses the window function.  By default, a Hamming window is used.
       Other window functions can be selected through a	pulldown menu labeled
       "<I>Windows</I>".  Additional window functions include Hanning,	and Triangu-
       lar.

  <B>-realtime</B>
       If this switch is given,	<I>afft</I> attempts to stay synchronized with	the
       audio server in real time.  If <I>afft</I> cannot get enough CPU cycles	to
       keep up with the	incoming audio stream, it may fall behind enough that
       it no longer captures valid audio data.	In non-realtime	mode (the
       default), <I>afft</I> will discard audio samples in order to keep up with
       real time.

  <B>-sine</B>

       Causes <I>afft</I> to begin operation in demo mode, which displays a sine
       curve sweep from	the minimum frequency up to the	Nyquist	cut-off	fre-
       quency.	<I>afft</I> can operate in this mode even if the audio	server is not
       running or no audio hardware is available.  <I>afft</I>	can be switched
       between demonstration mode and live mode	(input from the	audio server)
       by a pair of radio buttons labeled "<I>Live</I>" and "<I>Demo</I>.

  <B>-spec</B>

       Selects spectrogram display.  Otherwise,	a waterfall style of display
       is used.	 You can switch	at will	between	spectrogram and	waterfall by
       a pair of radio buttons labeled "<I>Waterfall</I>" and "<I>Spec</I>".

  <B>-stride</B> <I>stridelength</I>

       Sets the	number of samples that <I>afft</I> advances between FFT frames.
       Legal values are	512, 256, 128, and 64.	Default	value is 512.  How-
       ever, the stride	will never be greater than the FFT length (see
       above).	The stride can be changed while	<I>afft</I> is	running	by means of a
       pull-down menu labeled "<I>Stride</I>"
