NAME
  abrowse - X audio file browser

SYNOPSIS
  <B>abrowse</B> <B>[</B><I>dir</I><B>]</B>

DESCRIPTION
  This program implements an X based audio file	browser.  Double-click to
  play files and traverse directories.

  You can select different output devices with the "Output Device" option
  under	the File menu.

  If <I>dir</I> is specified, the file	window opens with the contents of that direc-
  tory.	 If not	specified, and the environment variable	<I>SOUND</I>_<I>PATH</I> is
  defined, the file window opens on the	first directory	in that	list.  Other-
  wise,	the file window	opens on the current directory.

  This program is implemented with the Tcl/Tk toolkit, which must be
  installed on your system for the program to run.

RESTRICTIONS
  There's no way to stop a playback once it is started.
