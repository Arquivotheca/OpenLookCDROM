NAME
  adial	- X Windows and	AF application to dial the phone

SYNOPSIS
  <B>adial</B>

DESCRIPTION
  This problem implements an X based phone dialler.  Type a number or name
  into the entry box and hit return, or	select a number	or name	somewhere on
  the screen and click dial.

  The application picks	up the telephone using <A HREF="../man1/ahs.html">ahs(1)</A> and dials	the phone
  using	<A HREF="../man1/aphone.html">aphone(1)</A>.  After that,	a through audio	connection is made to the
  local	handset	or headset using <A HREF="../man1/aset.html">aset(1)</A>.

  If the entry box is empty, then the current X	selection is used
       as the number.  You can type ^U in the entry box	to delete whatever is
       there.

  The entry (or	selection) is translated by <A HREF="../man1/aname2num.html">aname2num(1)</A> before
       being dialled.  See aname2num for details, but briefly, it can look up
       names in	a personal phone directory (usually ~/.phonelist).

  When the call	is finished, click Hangup.

  If you just want to answer the phone,	click Pickup.  Then use	Hangup to
       disconnect.

  This program is implemented with the Tcl/Tk toolkit, which must be installed
       on your system for the program to run.

RESTRICTIONS
  The name to number translation is fairly limited.  You can change it,	but
  you have to recode name2num.

ENVIRONMENT

  <B>AUDIOFILE</B>
	  to get the default host and server to	use.

BUGS
  If you encounter a <B>reproducible</B> bug, please submit a problem report to
  (af-bugs@crl.dec.com).
