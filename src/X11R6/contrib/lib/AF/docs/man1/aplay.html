NAME
  aplay	- An AF	play client.

SYNOPSIS
  <B>aplay</B>	[<B>-server</B> <I>audioserver</I>] [<B>-d</B> <I>device</I>] [<B>-t</B> <I>time</I>] [<B>-g</B>	<I>gain</I>] [<B>-e</B> <I>encoding</I>]
  [<B>-f</B> ]	[<B>-c</B>] [<B>-b</B>] [<B>-l</B>] [<I>file</I>]

DESCRIPTION
  <I>aplay</I>	reads samples from <I>file</I>, or stdin if <I>file</I> is not specified, and	sends
  the sound data to the	audio server for playback.  The	file is	assumed	to be
  of a sample format appropriate for the playback device.

OPTIONS

  <B>-server</B> <I>audioserver</I>

       Specifies which audio server to connect to in order to play the sound
       file.  If <I>audioserver</I> is	not specified, <I>aplay</I> uses the default server.
       See the AUDIOFILE environment variable.

  <B>-d</B> <I>device</I>

       Specifies which audio device to play the	sound file through.  If	<I>dev-</I>
       <I>ice</I> is not specified, <I>aplay</I> defaults to the first device	that isn't
       connected to the	telephone.

  <B>-t</B> <I>time</I>

       <I>time</I> can	be used	to adjust the audio device time	at which the the
       <I>aplay</I> client begins to play the sound data.  A positive value of	<I>time</I>
       will begin playing <I>time</I> seconds in the future.  If <I>time</I> is negative,
       <I>time</I> seconds of sound data will be "thrown away".  The default is 0.1
       seconds.

  <B>-e</B> <B>ncoding</B>

       <I>encoding</I>	will specify the type of the data being	read from the file or
       standard	input.	Legal values are described in the audio.h header
       file, and may be	obtained via aplay -e xxx.  The	-e flag	simply
       informs the AF server of	the datatype.Some encodings may	fail if	they
       are not supported by the	AF server.  See	also <A HREF="../man1/aconvert.html">aconvert(1)</A>.

  <B>-g</B> <I>gain</I>

       A <I>gain</I> in dB can	be used	to attenuate or	amplify	the sound data prior
       to mixing in the	audio server.

  <B>-f</B>

       The -f switch turns on flush mode, which	forces <I>aplay</I> to	wait until
       the last	sound has been played before exiting.

  <B>-c</B>

       The -c switch instructs <I>aplay</I> to	play to	the canonical sound bytes
       shipped with the	AF kit.	This switch depends on the <B>SOUND_PATH</B>
       environment variable.

  <B>-b</B>

       Specifies that for 16 bit data, the bytes are in	"Big Endian" byte
       order (e.g. Sparc, RIOS,	PA).

  <B>-l</B>

       Specifies that for 16 bit data, the bytes are in	"Little	Endian"	byte
       order (e.g. Alpha, Intel	x86, VAX).

  <I>file</I>

       <I>aplay</I> attempts to read from <I>file</I>	in the current working directory or
       from one	of the directories in the <B>SOUND_PATH</B> environment variable if
       it is set.

ENVIRONMENT

  <B>AUDIOFILE</B>	 specifies the host and	server to use.

  <B>SOUND_PATH</B>	 specifies a colon-separated list of directories in which
		 sounds	may be found.

BUGS
  There	is no way to play back a file in preempt mode.

  If you encounter a <B>reproducible</B> bug, please submit a problem report to
  (af-bugs@crl.dec.com).
