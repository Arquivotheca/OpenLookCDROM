DDESCRIPTION

  <I>apass</I>	reads samples from the input audio server and writes them to the out-
  put audio server.  There will	be <I>delay</I> seconds between input and output.

OPTIONS

  <B>-ia</B> <I>server</I>

       Specifies which audio server to record the sound	from.  Defaults	to
       the value of the	AUDIOFILE environment variable.


  <B>-oa</B> <I>server</I>

       Specifies which audio server to play the	sound to.  Defaults to the
       value of	the AUDIOFILE environment variable.


  <B>-full_duplex</B>

       Copies sound in both directions (between	input and output servers.)


  <B>-id</B> <I>device</I>

       Specifies which audio device on the input server	to record the sound
       from. Defaults to the first device that isn't connected to the tele-
       phone, which is often the local microphone device.


  <B>-od</B> <I>device</I>

       Specifies which audio device on the output server to play the sound
       to. Defaults to the first device	that isn't connected to	the tele-
       phone, which is often the local speaker device.


  <B>-delay</B> <I>seconds</I>

       Sets the	record to playback delay.  The default value is	0.2 seconds.
       This delay is made up of	three components, the buffer size - because
       you cannot play back a sample until the whole buffer is recorded, the
       nominal anti-jitter delay, which	absorbs	variation in the scheduling
       and transport delays between the	record server and the playback
       server, and a pure delay.  The minimum value is <I>buffering</I>+<I>aj</I> and	the
       maximum is 3.0 seconds.


  <B>-aj</B> <I>seconds</I>

       Sets the	tolerance for clock drift between the input and	the output.
       If the input to output delay drifts from	its nominal value by more
       than this amount, the delay will	be resynchronized, probably resulting
       in an audible blip.  Default value is 0.1 seconds.  Legal values	are 0
       to 1 second.

  <B>-buffering</B> <I>seconds</I>

       This parameter sets the amount of audio read from the input and writ-
       ten to the output as a single operation.	 It sets a minimum value for
       <I>delay</I>.  The default value is 0.2	seconds.  Legal	values are 0.1 to 0.5
       second.

  <B>-g</B> <I>dB</I>-<I>gain</I>

       Controls	the playback gain.  The	default	value is 0 dB.	Legal values
       are from	-30 to +30.

  <B>-e</B> <I>encodingType</I>

       Sets the	encoding type of the audio.  This information is passed	to
       the sending and receiving AF servers, where any necessary conversions
       will be done.  "-e xxx" will get	a list of acceptable types.  Some
       types may not be	supported by some servers.  If the -e switch is	not
       specified, the encoding type will be the	natural	type of	the input AF
       device.

  <B>-log</B>

       If set, apass will print	a message on stdout whenever it	is necessary
       to resynchronize	clocks between input and output	and whenever the
       record side of the program takes	longer than 400	milliseconds.

  <B>-f</B> <I>file</I>

       Whenever	a SIGUSR1 is received, <I>apass</I> will read <I>file</I> to acquire param-
       eters.  The parameter file should contain one or	more lines.  Each
       value should have a keyword and a value.	 Legal keywords	are delay,
       buffering, aj, and gain.

       A typical parameter file	might contain:

	       delay 0.3
	       buffering 0.2
	       aj 0.1
	       gain 0.0

       The general idea	behind the -f <I>file</I> feature is that another process
       can be used to control the <I>apass</I>	process.  For example, a <A HREF="../man1/tk.html">tk(1)</A> pro-
       gram or emacs keybindings could alter the behavior of apass.  This
       permits a multi-process but single threaded environment to act like a
       multi-threaded environment.

ENVIRONMENT

  <B>AUDIOFILE</B>	 specifies the host and	server to use if otherwise unspeci-
		 fied
