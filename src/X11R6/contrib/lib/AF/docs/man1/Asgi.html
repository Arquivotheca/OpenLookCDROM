NAME
  <I>Asgi</I> - a network-transparent audio server for	SGI Indigo workstations

SYNOPSIS
  The AF audio server is a network transparent	system developed at Digital
  CRL.	The audio server described in this manual page supports	the SGI
  Indigo audio hardware	and software.

DESCRIPTION
  <I>Asgi</I> is an AF	server with device dependent support for SGI Indigo and
  Indigo2 workstations.

STARTING UP
  Asgi [:<I>portOffset</I>] [<I>options</I>] &amp;

OPTIONS

  <B>-help</B>
       Use the help switch to determine	device independent arguments.

  <B>-rate</B>	<I>sampling</I>-<I>rate</I>
       Specify the sampling rate.  Valid sampling rates	are all	rates sup-
       ported by the SGI Indigo	audio hardware:	8000, 11025, 16000, 22050,
       32000, 44100 and	48000 samples/sec.  The	default	is 8000.  The sam-
       pling rate is used both for recording and for playback, and should not
       be changed using	the apanel utility (in fact the	server resets it when
       it detects it is	changed).

AUDIO DEVICES
  This server supports three devices, which provide different types of acces
  to a single audio device: device 0 accepts mono U-LAW	samples, device	1
  accepts mono 16-bit linear samples, device 1 accepts stereo 16-bit samples.
  (Don't confuse these devices with the	<I>portOffset</I> in the connection name
  explained below.)

  The hardware has a choice of three input sources: input 0 is the line	input
  jack,	input 1	is the microphone, input 2 is the digital input.  Exactly one
  of these is selected at any time.

CONNECTION NAME
  From the user's prospective, every AF	server has an <I>audio</I> <I>connection</I> of the
  form:

			      <I>hostname</I>:<I>portOffset</I>

  This information is used by the application to determine how it should con-
  nect to the server.

  <I>hostname</I>
	  The <I>hostname</I> specifies the name of the machine to which the audio
	  device is physically connected.  If omitted, the local machine is
	  used and the fastest available protocol is chosen (e.g. UNIX sock-
	  ets or shared	memory).

  <I>portOffset</I>
	  The <I>portOffset</I> is used to identify the audio server's	port on	<I>host-</I>
	  <I>name</I>.	 For example, to simultaneously	run two	audio servers on a
	  given	host, you might	select <I>0</I> or <I>1</I> for <I>portOffset</I>.

  If the connection name to an audio server is not specified, then the
  environment variables	<I>AUDIOFILE</I> or <I>DISPLAY</I> will be used.

ACCESS CONTROL
  The sample server provides two types of access control: an authorization
  protocol which provides a list of ``magic cookies'' clients can send to
  request access, and a	list of	hosts from which connections are always
  accepted.

BUGS
  At high sampling rates the server uses too much CPU when sounds are
  recorded and played.

  If you encounter a <B>repeatable</B>	bug in the SGI dependent code, please submit
  a problem report to <I>guido</I>@<I>cwi</I>.<I>nl</I> and include the source code if possible.
