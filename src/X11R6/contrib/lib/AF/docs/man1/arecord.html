DDESCRIPTION

  <I>arecord</I> reads	samples	from the audio server and writes the data to <I>file</I>, or
  stdout if <I>file</I> is not	specified.  The	file will be written in	a sample for-
  mat appropriate for the record device.  By default, the byte order of	any
  16 bit data will be that of the host on which	arecord	is executing.

OPTIONS

  <B>-server</B> <I>audioserver</I>

       Specifies which audio server to connect to in order to record the
       sound file.  If <I>audioserver</I> is not specified, <I>arecord</I> uses the default
       server.	See the	AUDIOFILE environment variable.

  <B>-d</B> <I>device</I>

       Specifies which audio device to record the sound	file from.  If <I>device</I>
       is not specified, <I>arecord</I> defaults to the first device that isn't con-
       nected to the telephone.

  <B>-l</B> <I>length</I>

       <I>length</I> of sound data to record, specified in seconds.

  <B>-silentlevel</B> <I>level</I>

       <I>level</I> (in dBm) below which the sound is deemed to be silent.  The
       default value is	-60

  <B>-silenttime</B> <I>time</I>

       <I>time</I> (in	seconds) of silence which will terminate the recording.	 The
       default value is	3.0.

       If either -silentlevel or -silenttime is	set, then arecord will ter-
       minate recording	after so many seconds of "silence".

  <B>-e</B> <B>ncoding</B>

       <I>encoding</I>	will specify the type of the data to be	written	to the file
       or standard output.  Legal values are described in the audio.h header
       file, and may be	obtained via arecord -e	xxx.  The -e flag simply
       informs the AF server of	the datatype. Some encodings may fail if they
       are not supported by the	AF server.  See	also <A HREF="../man1/aconvert.html">aconvert(1)</A>.

  <B>-g</B> <I>gain</I>

       A <I>gain</I> in dB can	be used	to attenuate or	amplify	the sound data prior
       to recording from the audio server.  Many AF servers do not support
       client gain on record, so use with suspicion.

  <B>-printpower</B>

       Print input power level in dBm on stderr	every block (8 times a
       second).

  <B>-B</B>

       Specifies that for 16 bit data, the bytes are in	"Big Endian" byte
       order (e.g. Sparc, RIOS,	PA).

  <B>-L</B>

       Specifies that for 16 bit data, the bytes are in	"Little	Endian"	byte
       order (e.g. Alpha, Intel	x86, VAX).

  <B>-t</B> <I>time</I>

       <I>time</I> can	be used	to adjust the audio device time	at which the the
       <I>arecord</I> client begins to	record the sound data.	A positive value of
       <I>time</I> will begin recording <I>time</I> seconds in the future.  If <I>time</I> is
       negative, sound data will be returned from <I>time</I> seconds in the past.
       If the <I>time</I> offset begins earlier than the start	of the recording
       buffer, silence will be returned.  Defaults to 0.125 seconds.

  <I>file</I>

       <I>arecord</I> writes data to <I>file</I> in the current working directory

ENVIRONMENT

  <B>AUDIOFILE</B>	 specifies the host and	server to use.
