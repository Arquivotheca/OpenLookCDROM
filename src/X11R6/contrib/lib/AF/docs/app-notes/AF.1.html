<H1>Automatic Datatype Conversion in AF3</H1>

<BODY>
<H1>Introduction</H1>

AF audio servers may support one or more audio devices.  Each audio device 
will have a native sampling rate and datatype that is visible to client 
applications.<P>

With AF3, client applications may choose to use their own preferred 
datatype when communicating with an audio server.  They do not need to use 
the datatype native to an audio device.<P>

To use automatic datatype conversion, client applications must set the 
<I>ACEncodingType</I> attribute in an <I>AC</I> (audio context.) Clients 
may set their preferred encoding type on the call to <A 
HREF="../man3/AFCreateAC.html"><I>AFCreateAC(3)</I></A> or through a call 
to <A 
HREF="../man3/AFChangeACAttributes.html"><I>AFChangeACAtributes(3)</I></A>.<P>

All popular scalar datatypes are currently supported as well as several 
compressed datatypes.<P>

<A HREF="../man3/AFFindEncodeType.html"><I>AFFindEncodeType(3)</I></A> 
will accept a encoding type string and return the matching enumerated 
encoding type for setting the attribute type. <A 
HREF="../man3/AFPrintKnownEncodingTypes.html"><I>AFPrintKnownEncodingTypes(3)</I></A> will print to stderr all defined strings and their accepted alternate names.<P>

<H1>AF3 Clients</H1>

As shipped with AF3, the <I>aplay</I>, <I>arecord</I>, and <I>apass</I> 
clients support a command line switch (<I>-e encoding_type</I>) that is 
used to convey the audio sample datatype between the client and server.<P>

To play a mu-law sound file against an audio device with a native datatype 
other than mu-255, use
<PRE>
	aplay [-d device no.] -e ulaw filename
</PRE>


<H1>Client Example</H1>

The following example demonstrates how to take a given audio device and 
force client-server communication to use mu-255 (log PCM) samples. Assume 
the audio device was properly selected by <I>FindDefaultDevice()</I>, is 
running at the correct sampling rate, and has the correct number of 
channels.

<PRE>
#include &lt;AF/AFlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;AF/AFUtils.h&gt;

    AFAudioConn *aud;
    AC ac;
    AFSetACAttributes attributes;
    int device;

    /* Open connection to default audio server */
    if ( (aud = AFOpenAudioConn(NULL)) == NULL) {
	fprintf(stderr, "%s: can't open connection.\n", argv[0]);
	exit(1);
    }

    /* Select the proper audio device */
    device = FindDefaultDevice(aud);

    /* Set the preferred attributes for audio context, include datatype */
    attributes.preempt = Mix;
    attributes.play_gain = 0;
    attributes.type = MU255;

    /* Now create the audio context */
    ac = AFCreateAC(aud, device, (ACPlayGain | ACEncodingType)), &attributes);

    /* Make sure we confirm encoding type is supported. */
    AFSync(aud, 0);
