NAME
  <B>AFSingleTone</B> - generate a tone

SYNTAX
  <B>#include</B> <B>&lt;AF/AFUtils.h&gt;</B>

  extern double	<B>AFSingleTone</B>(double <I>freq</I>, double <I>peak</I>,
					  double <I>phase</I>,
					  float	*<I>buffer</I>, int <I>length</I>);

DESCRIPTION
  <I>AFSingleTone</I> is a flexible subroutine	for generating and combining sinewave
  signals.  The	generated signal is ADDED into the output buffer, so the
  client of this procedure has the responsibility for initially	zeroing	the
  buffer.  Multiple tones can be generated by repeated calls.

ARGUMENTS

  <I>freq</I> is the desired digital frequency, expressed as a	fraction of the	sam-
       pling rate.  The	value should be	in the range 0.0 to 0.5.

  <I>peak</I> is the peak value of the	sine wave desired.

  <I>phase</I>
       is the initial phase desired.  This should be in	the range
       [0.0..1024.0).  It is used as an	initial	index into the sine wave
       table <A HREF="../man3/AF_sine_float.html">AF_sine_float(3)</A>.	The return value from AFSingleTone is the
       final phase.  If	the return value is passed to a	second invocation of
       AFSingleTone, the resulting wave	will be	continuous at the boundary.

  <I>buffer</I>
       is a pointer to the signal buffer that will be filled in	by
       AFTonePair.

  <I>length</I>
       is the length of	the block desired.
