 <LI><DT>Which platforms have AF server support?
	<DL>Currently, AF3 servers exist for the following systems:
	<DL>
	<DT>OSF/1 for Alpha, TURBOchannel-based Workstations
	<DD>
		  <UL>
		  <LI><I>Aaxp</I> manages the 
			  base-board audio hardware on Alpha workstations.
		  <LI><I>Aj300</I> manages the J300 Sound and Motion
			TURBOchannel audio hardware.
		  <LI><I>Alofi</I> manages the LoFi/DECaudio 
			  TURBOchannel audio hardware.
		  <LI><I>Ajv</I> manages the J-Video <emph>prototype</emph>
			TURBOchannel audio hardware.
		  </UL>
	<DT>OSF/1 for Alpha, Alpha PC 150
	<DD>
		  <UL>
		  <LI><I>Amsb</I> manages the Microsoft Sound Board
			   audio hardware on an Alpha PC.
		  </UL>
	<DT>Ultrix/RISC
	<DD>
		  <UL>
		  <LI><I>Alofi</I> manages the LoFi/DECaudio
			   TURBOchannel audio hardware.
		  <LI><I>Amaxine</I> manages the 
			base-board audio hardware on Personal 
			  DECstations.
		  <LI><I>Ajv</I> manages the J-Video <emph>prototype</emph> 
			TURBOchannel audio hardware.
		  </UL>
	<DT>SGI Irix
	<DD>
		  <UL>
		  <LI><I>Asgi</I> manages the audio hardware on Indigo.
		  </UL>
	<DT>SunOS
	<DD>
		  <UL>
		  <LI><I>Asparc</I> manages the base-board audio hardware on Sparcstations.
		  <LI>SparcStation 10 dda support coming soon?
		  </UL>
	</DL>
	</DL></LI>

 <LI><DT>Can I use the AUDIOFILE environment variable to indicate which
	audio device I want to use?
	<DL>No. The AUDIOFILE variable is used to specify the default
	audio server to connect with and cannot be used to select
	the audio device within an audio server.<P>
	See the <I>Connection Name</I> section in 
	one of the server man pages for more details about the format
	of this environment variable 
	(e.g., <A HREF="man1/Aj300.html">Aj300</A>).<P>
	</DL></LI>

 <LI><DT>How do I select an audio device?
	<DL>A server will support one or more audio devices numbered [0...N).
	The simplest way to probe the list of audio devices is to use the
	<I>aset</I> client application,
	<PRE>
		aset q
	</PRE>
	and examine the result.  The output is formatted as a table with
	each row describing an audio device's attributes, and current state.<P>
	The mapping of an audio device to a connector on the audio hardware
	is server specific.
	</DL></LI>

 <LI><DT>Is there a GUI front-end for aplay that I can use with Mosaic?
	<DL>There is a simple Tk-based application called tkPlay in the 
	contrib/clients tree within AF3.  tkPlay allows you to control
	the output audio device, output gain, as well as other aplay
	command line switches.
	This app depends on having Tcl/Tk 
	installed before use. </DL></LI>

<OL>

 <LI><DT>Some server's audio devices export linear PCM-16 datatypes and others 
	export mu-law.  Will the server do datatype conversion for me?
	<DL>Yes.  
	Clients can set the encoding type for playing or recording samples
	through an Audio Context.
	Clients can select among all popular scalar datatypes and several
	compressed datatypes; the audio server will automatically 
	perform the datatype conversion for the client application.
	<P>
	</DL></LI>

 <LI><DT>Do the servers also support compressed datatypes?
	<DL>Yes.  For example, IMA, GSM, a computationally simple
	ADPCM algorithm (2,3, and 4 bit quanitization), etc.</DL></LI>

 <LI><DT>Does AF understand structured audio file formats?
	<DL>With AF3, we now include a customized version of 
	the SOX library (Wes Whitnah, Tektronix).  However, while this
	permits you to more easily write client apps that read and write
	structured audio file formats, the common apps in AF3 (aplay
	and arecord) do not yet have knowledge of file formats.
	This will be corrected soon. </DL></LI>

 <LI><DT>Why is the performance of the Amaxine server so poor (on the Personal
	DECstation)?
	<DL>The performance woes on the Personal DECstation are mostly
	due to the device driver.  We no longer have Personal
	DECstations at CRL and will not try to improve the performance.
	We would welcome contributions if you choose to make source
	code changes that significantly improve the performance.</DL></LI>

 <LI><DT>Why do I get <emph>bba:  ISDN_DMA_ERROR</emph> error messages on
	the console of my Personal DECstation?  Can I safely ignore these
	messages?
	<DL>These are error messages from the bba driver on the Personal 
	DECstation (these messsage do not occur on other systems).  You 
	cannot make it stop other than by not running applications that use 
	the /dev/bba device, (e.g. the Amaxine server).  Although a few 
	audio samples are lost when this occurs, you can otherwise safely 
	ignore these messages.</DL></LI>

<H1><A NAME="Build">Building AF3 and AF3 Clients</A></H1>
<OL>

 <LI><DT>How do I create a client AF Makefile from an Imakefile? 
	<DL>Use the <I>amkmf</I> utility (<emph>not xmkmf</emph>) which is 
	typically installed in /usr/local/bin/AF/amkmf. </DL></LI>

 <LI><DT>I am having trouble building AF3 on 4.3a/4.4 of Ultrix, am I doing
	something wrong?

	<DL>I do not understand the exact cause of the problem, but it is 
	related to the new compiler provided with Ultrix 4.3a.  The 
	compiler includes a backwards compatibility switch (see the cc man 
	page).  Add the <I>-oldc</I> switch to your default ccflags def in 
	ultrix.cf (DefaultCCOptions) and try rebuilding the World. I 
	believe this will "fix" your problems.<P> </DL></LI>

 <LI><DT>I try to build AF3 from source and I get complaints about 
	dependencies on files that do not exist.  What am I doing wrong? 
	<DL>One of the more common problems with people building from an 
	original source kit is not following the 
        <A HREF="./RELNOTES.html"><I>make World</I></A>
	instructions.  AF3 uses many of the same tools and configuration 
	utilities as does X11, including the program imake.  One of the 
	first steps that occurs when rebuilding <I>World</I> is to make 
	your local imake which is subsequently used to rebuild all 
	Makefiles in the hierarchy.  Later, dependencies are created in the 
	new Makefiles.<P> 

	The problem alluded to by the question is typically caused by 
	attempting to short-cut the process and build specific binary 
	targets using the Makefiles included in the original source kit.<P> 
	</DL></LI>


 <LI><DT>Can I build AF3 on Solaris (V2.3, the AF documentation
	only refers to SunOS 4.1.3)?
	<DL>Shortly after the release of AF3R1, there should be a patch kit 
	available that will enable you to build and use AF3 under Solaris 
	(Wes Whitnah, Tektronix).</DL></LI>

<OL>

 <LI><DT>What features are being planned for the future? <DL>The most 
	significant change under consideration is to include a general 
	sampling rate conversion utility within the server (similar to 
	encoding datatype conversion) to allow client applications to view 
	an audio device as having their own preferred sampling-rate (with 
	AF3 clients can select the datatype.)</DL></LI>

 <LI><DT>Is AF "supported"? 
	<DL>AF is not officially supported. AF is distributed in source 
	code form with an fairly unrestrictive copyright.  We use AF for 
	audio and speech research here at CRL and support it on a best 
	effort basis.  Since it is distributed in source code, we welcome 
	bug fixes (preferably in the form of patches to the last released 
	source code kit.) </DL></LI>

<LI><DT>How do I make contributions?
	<DL>We welcome contributed clients or libraries as long as they 
	carry a similar copyright notice as the core AF kit. Should you 
	wish to make a contribution to the AF kit, send mail to the 
	<I>af-bugs@crl.dec.com</I> to ask for specific information. 
	</DL></LI>

 <LI><DT>How does AF3 relate to NETaudio?
	<DL>Both are relatively popular distributed audio systems. While 
	they both have some features in common, AF uniquely provides the 
	device-time feature.      We are working together with NCD towards 
	developing a common audio system that incorporates the better 
	features of both Netaudio and AF.<P> </DL></LI>

 <LI><DT>Where can I get the Ak kit?
	<DL>crl.dec.com:/pub/misc/ak-0.7.tar.Z</DL></LI>

 <LI><DT>What are the current mailing lists/newsgroups for AF3?
 	<DL>
	<PRE>
af@crl.dec.com		General af mailing list topics
af-bugs@crl.dec.com	Send problem reports to this list
af-request@crl.dec.com	For (un)subscribing to the af list
	</PRE>
