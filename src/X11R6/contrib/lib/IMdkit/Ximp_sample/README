   implementaion Input Method Protocol in the X Window System, Version
   11, Release 5.

   The sampleIM is just sample, so remember that it can be used just for
   test of IMServer Developers Kit, and note that it should be invoked
   under Japanese EUC locale such as "ja_JP.eucJP", because it contains
   the Japanese EUC localized characters for the sample committed
   string:
