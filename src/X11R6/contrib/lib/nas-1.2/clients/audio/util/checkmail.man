.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIcheckmail\fP program checks the status of the user's mail drop.
If new mail is waiting, \fIcheckmail\fP runs \fIplaybucket\fP to play
a sound and returns an exit status of 0.  If mail has been cleared,
an exit status of 2 is returned.  If there has been no change,
an exit status of 1 is returned.

The \fIcheckmail\fP program is intended to be used with the
\fBcheckCommand\fP resource of \fIxbiff\fP.  To set this resource,
add the following line to your \fI.Xdefaults\fP file:
