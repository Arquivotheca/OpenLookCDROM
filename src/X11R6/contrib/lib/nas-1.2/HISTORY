** Release 1.2 **

General
	o A few cosmetic changes.

** PATCH 02 **

Server
	o fixed a bug with monitor elements not returning the correct
	  data.  This caused the meters in audemo to be broken.

	o patches from Steven King

	    - In server/os/connections.c, EstablishNewConnections
              probably ought to check that newconn is less than
              lastfdesc before it is used in the BITSET macro (this in
              the mit X11r5 source, havent looked at r6 yet), tho
              you'd need lots and lots of connections to tickle
              this. Also in connections.c, CheckConnections should
              probably check for EINTR if select returns an error, I
              dont know if any implementation of select would actually
              EINTR for if it got a SIGPOLL or SIGALRM if the timeout
              is zero, but better safe than sorry.

            - FallbackDefineSelf exists and is only referenced in
              os/access.c. Its part of the localconn patch which
              obviously isnt handling non 386 svr4's correctly.

Library
	o fixed a bug in AuSoundRecordToData().  The flow wasn't getting
	  stopped when the recording was finished.

	o fixed compile problem in ConnSvr.c under Dell 2.2 Xfree86-2.1.1.

	o fixed compile problems under some X11R4s that don't define _Xconst.

Clients
	o fixed problem with audial -recognize messing with line mode and
	  gain attributes without checking to see if the device was capable.

	o fixed range/clipping problem in effectsAmplitude in auedit.

General
	o changed occurances of the name "NetAudio" to "Network Audio System"
          or "NAS" due to a name conflict.

	o patches from Ian Donaldson

	    - Solaris 2 server failed to link because of undefined
	      symbol FallbackDefineSelf().

	    - Shared library compilation broke completely due to
	      changes in NetAudio.tmpl and because the include of
	      <Library.tmpl> was moved too high up in
	      lib/audio/Imakefile, and missed out on the
	      DoSharedLib/DoNormalLib flags etc.

** PATCH 01 **

Server
	o fixed a couple of problems with speed changes in the
	  SVR4 VOXware driver.

** Release 1.2b BETA **

Library
	o fixed possible bogus free in sound.c.

Clients
	o fixed auwave dropping core (due to bugs in the slider widget).

General
	o lots of stuff from Steven King.  See CHANGES.sk below for details.

	o The file server/PATCHES.sk contains patches from Steven King to
	  improve the handling of audio clipping in the server. I've
	  not applied them to the standard distribution yet because
	  I'm concerned about their possible performance impact.

	o added some documentation about actions.

** PATCH 01 **

Server
	o fixed a bug with looping flows.

Library
	o fixed problem with X11R4 build.

** Release 1.2a ALPHA **

Server
	o fixed a bug in ReadElement that would occasionally cause
	  protocol errors during recording.

	o wake up the server when there are events to send out.

	o fixed a bug in readBucket() that caused noise at the end of
	  a bucket.

	o get rid of minibuf padding to eliminate clicks.

	o optimized sample rate conversion.

	o added FreeBSD/Linux VOXware driver (thanks to Amancio Hasty).

	o added SVR4 VOXware driver (thanks to Stephen Hocking).

	o added line mode control to Sun dbri driver.

Library
	o add AuXtAppRemoveAudioHandler().

	o fixed memory leaks and other problems with the bucket attribute
	  cache.

	o fix some nits with waveform durations.

Clients
	o new auphone sample app.

	o added some simple examples.

General
	o much cleaning and various OS support fixes from
	  Ian M. Donaldson.  See CHANGES.labtam below for details.

** Release ?.? ALPHA (Feburary 11, 1994) **

Server
	o fixed a bug where the last little bit of audio data would be
	  lost.

	o fixed a bug in readClient where the buffer was being incorrectly
	  padded, possibly resulting in static at the end of the audio data.

	o fixed two track monitor elements.

	o Sun driver

		- fixed a bug that could cause the output to get jumbled.

		- wait for audio to drain after flows finish.

		- Sparc 10 dbri driver.

Library
	o added API for set and get close down mode.

	o added Amiga IFF/8SVX sound file support.

	o close the sound file before the callback is called for
	  AuSoundRecordToFile().

	o make ListBuckets add to the bucket cache.

	o added file format suffixes to the SoundFileInfo structure.

	o added AuSetString() macro.

	o fixed "strdup" bug in SoundCreate.

	o re-arranged some utility routines into separate modules.
	  (NOTE: possible incompatibility - AuMonitorRate and AuMonitorFormat
	         are no longer externed in audioutil.h)

	o add AuWaveFormToString() and AuStringToWaveForm().

	o add AuSoundRecordToData().

	o add stereo support for voc files (thanks to Steven King).

Clients
	o auedit

		- deal with sound files with an unknown number of samples
		  (like those from stdin).

		- add record capability.

	o utilities

		- various new utilities.

	o new auwave sample app.

	o new slider widget for volume/gain controls.

General
	o re-worked the includes of NetAudio.tmpl so it will (hopefully)
	  work on most platforms.

	o builds under SVR3.2 (thanks to Steven King).

** Release 1.1 **

Server
	o Protected malloc/free from audio signals.

	o Fixed setting parameters of waveforms and buckets.

	o New dia/dda interface.

	o Fixed a bug where the flow was re-compiled after
	  an event was requested even if that event didn't change
	  the state of the flow.

	o Fixed possible memory trashing in readClient.

	o Sun driver

		- Don't initialize output gain or internal/external speaker
		  mode.

		- Get rid of some 'clicks'.

		- Deal with the situation when there are no physical outputs
		  in a flow.  This fixes the core dumps when you record before
		  having played anything.

		- Fixed erroneous calling of AuProcessData() after changing
		  gain values.

		- Fixed various bugs in recording (how did it ever work?!)

	o New SGI driver (thanks to Reiner Ernst)

Library
	o Fixed a bug in AuConvertShortToData().

	o Fixed function prototypes in Xtutil.h.

	o Fixed a problem in Xtutil.c where events would not get processed
	  if they were enqueued while awaiting a reply.

Clients
	o auedit
		Fixed a bug with temporary and backup file names.

	o auconvert
		Fixed a bug with converting raw data.

General
	o Solaris 2.2 support


********************************************************************************
			      CHANGES.labtam
********************************************************************************

Many thanks to Ian M. Donaldson at Labtam for the following:

- Now compiles cleanly on all these without any compiler warnings
  whatsoever (well the odd one or two under X11R4).

	- Solaris 2.3 on SS1000 under Sun provided Open Windows 3.2
	  Server untested.  
	      (We only have a SS1000 running 2.3 which has no audio device)

	  Porting required because Sun changed the audio interface
	  slightly in Solaris 2 versus SunOS 4.

	  Clients tested reasonably.

	- AIX 3.2 on a RS6000/220 under IBM provided X11R4
	  No server port done.  Don't have access to any IBM audio hardware.
	  Clients tested reasonably.

	- SunOS 4.1.2  on a Sun IPX under MIT provided X11R5.
	  (no porting required specific to this platform)
	  Both clients and server tested reasonably.

	- SVR4.0/486  on one of our own computers under MIT provided X11R5.
	  (as a guess comparable to Dell SVR4.0 or ESIX SVR4.0)
	  We used native STREAMSCONN TLI TCP/IP transport.
	  No server port done.  This computer never had audio hardware.
	  Clients tested reasonably.

	- SVR3.2/486  on one of our own computers under MIT provided X11R4.
	  This O/S uses Lachman provided TCP/IP, and we used
	  STREAMSCONN TLI TCP/IP transport.
	  No server port done.  This computer never had audio hardware.
	  Clients tested reasonably.

	  Unfortuantely every SVR3.2 system has some different
	  quirk since TCP was non-standard then.   No guarantees
	  it will compile better on other types.

- Bugfixes
	- server had byte swapping  error that crashed playbucket(1)
	  when client run from opposite endian host

	- autool crashed on little endian host when volume slider was
	  used when stopped (hung on big endian host)

	- various signal mis-use.  Background processes from non-job
	  control shells don't die when ^C hit anymore.

	- "SVR4" is not a reliable symbol for use in Imakefiles; use SystemV4
	  instead.  (broke audial).

	- in Netaudio.tmpl, don't redefine MKDIRHIER or BINDIR by
	  default as this breaks the bootstrap in subtle ways on 
	  certain systems.  Audio clients now get installed in the
	  same directory that X clients do rather than /usr/local/bin.

	  On Solaris 2.3 with OpenWindows, this means /usr/openwin/bin,
	  otherwise it usually means /usr/bin/X11.
	  Similarly for header files, app-defaults and libraries.

	- build will not fail on systems that don't have servers ported
	  to them.  This allows the clients and libraries to be built
	  on all platforms and servers on a subset.

- libaudio is built as a shared library (currently rev 2.0) on systems
  where libX11 is built shared.  In the list above that means
  Solaris 2.3, SunOS 4.1, SVR4.0.
  I used rev 1.0 for the September 93 netaudio release but changes
  between then and netaudio 1.1 looked somewhat incompatable so I bumped
  the revision number then.

- X11R4 compatability re-added in so compiliation in those 
  environments is now possible.

- STREAMSCONN support for SVR3.2 and SVR4.0 for libaudio.  
  This is a direct port from MIT X11R5 with the odd fix-tracker applied.
  NB: Not done for auscope(1).  sockets used in that case.
  (this is ok but if people want binary compatability from SVR3.2
  to SVR4 sockets won't work because SVR3.2 has no standard socket ABI)

- Better System-V and SVR4 support

	- Use System-V reliable signals.  (ie: sigset(2)).  
	  signal(2) is unreliable on System-V systems.
	  Didn't bother with SVR4/POSIX signals; SVR3 signals work
	  fine on SVR4 and are easier to understand and code.

	- don't use libucb at all on SVR4.  This library is bad news
	  on most SVR4 systems and should be avoided like the plague!

- Better ANSI support (SVR4 + Solaris)

	- use ANSI memcpy/memset exclusively on ANSI systems instead
	  of bcopy/bzero

	- eliminated all SVR4.0/486 cc's reported warnings of callback
	  function type declaration mismatches.  (this is the bulk
	  of the changes).  Solaris 2 cc doesn't report half these things
	  unfortunately.

- auscope(1) now has a '-n' flag so it can be run in background reliably.

- 'make install' now fully installs correctly.  Even app-defaults!

- 'make clean' now properly cleans

Thanks to Steven King for the following:

- building on ISC

    I had a few problems building 1.2a on my system running ISC SVR3.2r4.0
    with the imake enviroment provided by XFree86 (It looks to be more
    work than its worth to get netaudio to build with the vendor supplied
    X11R4).

    In server/dia/au.h, ISC doesnt have memmove, however bcopy and friends
    are in the normal library search path.

    In lib/audio/Alibnet.h, the omission of the #define for _AuWriteV
    resulted in link errors for all clients.

    In lib/audio/Imakefile, the SYSV_DEFINES macro causes major grief if
    one has installed XFree, I would expect this to be true for any SVR32
    that has XFree.  Also, I found it usefull to include NetAudio.tmpl
    after Library.tmp so that I could redefine things like CDEBUGFLAGS and
    such in NetAudio.tmpl

    In clients/audio/audemo/audemo.c, ISC needed sys/time.h included, I
    suspect most SYSV's will as well.

    In clients/audio/audial/audial.c, the compile breaks on the inclusion
    of sys/file.h, I think this is a ISC 4.0 specific problem.

- localconn patches

    These patches are derived from the XFree86 2.0 release.  I pretty much
    just merged the XFree patches into netaudio.  My principle interest
    was in the streams localconn code for ISC; besides greatly improving
    the performance for local clients, they allow the server to run with
    the system at run level 2, or on systems where full networking isnt
    availible (an extra $$$ option on ISC and lots of other PC sysVs).
     In addition to the ISC code, theres also support for other systems, SVR4,
    SCO, linux and net/free bsd, which may or may not be usefull depending
    on the system (ie, is anyone doing an independent SCO port?).  There
    is also alot of code for a minix and amoeba port.  I can pretty much
    guarantee that this will not work, but I left it in as it doesnt affect
    the other systems and might give a leg up to anyone attempting a minix
    or amoeba port.

- NetAudio.tmpl

    Make clients get rebuilt after libaudio.a changes.
