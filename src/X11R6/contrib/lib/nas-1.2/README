This directory tree contains sources for the Network Audio System, a
network-transparent, client/server audio system, including:

    o   sample server implementations

	- Sun Sparc 1 AM79C30A Digital Subscriber Controller and
	      Sparc 10 Dual Basic Rate ISDN Interface
	  (SunOS 4.1.[23], Solaris 2.x)

	- SGI Indigo (IRIX 5.x)

	- VOXware (FreeBSD, Linux, SVR4.[02])

    o	an application programming interface library
    o	a variety of sample applications

The client software can also be used with several models of NCD X
terminals.

Key features of the Network Audio System include:

    o	Device-independent audio over the network
    o	Lots of audio file and data formats
    o	Can store sounds in server for rapid replay
    o	Extensive mixing, separating, and manipulation of audio data
    o	Simultaneous use of audio devices by multiple applications
    o	Use by a growing number of ISVs
    o	Small size
    o	Free!  No obnoxious licensing terms

Please note that the Network Audio System has no relationship to the NetAudio 
products from Townshend Computer Tools.

Look at the file doc/xcon94paper.ps for a paper on the Network Audio
System.

I.  Roadmap

Here is a quick guide to where things are in this distribution (relative to
the directory nas/):

	README			this file
	HISTORY			log of changes
	BUGS			known landmines
	BUILDNOTES		notes on building under various OSs, X releases
	TODO			things we'd like to get around to doing
	RELEASE			release identification
	doc/			not enough documentation; overview, slides, lib
	config/			a little bit of imake stuff
	lib/audio/		API used by sample programs
	clients/audio/		sample programs
	server/			server code
	    dia/		device-independent bits
	    dda/sun/		device-dependent audio driver for Sun
	    dda/sgi/		device-dependent audio driver for SGI Indigo
	    dda/voxware/	device-dependent audio driver for VOXware

When built, the server will be in server/[ausun,ausgi,auvoxware], the 
library in lib/audio/libaudio.a, and the sample applications in
clients/audio/aufoo/aufoo.

In addition, the separate distribution sounds.tar.Z contains a directory of
example sounds:

	examples/sounds/	various sounds that can be played

If you don't have your own sound bites to nibble, grab these.

				 *  *  *  *  *

II.  Building the Release

To build the software:

    1.	Make sure you have imake.
	(See the BUILDNOTES file if you want to try building with X11R4).

    2.	Look at config/NetAudio.tmpl and add a BINDIR definition if you want.
	By default, the programs are put into /usr/bin/X11.

	(WARNING: if you have installed NetAudio.tmpl in your
	 /usr/lib/X11/config directory, imake will use it instead of the
	 one in nas/config.)

    3.	Do "xmkmf" to create the initial Makefile.

    4.	Do "make World" (note the uppercase World) to build the distribution.

    5.	If everything built successfully, you can install it using
	"make install"; to temporarily stage it under some directory, use
	"make install DESTDIR=/usr/tmp/nas" or some such.

    6.	To install the manual pages, use "make install.man" or 
	"make install.man DESTDIR=/usr/tmp/nas" as above.

A complete installation should include the following files:

	/usr/include/audio/Afuncproto.h		Header files
	/usr/include/audio/Afuncs.h
	/usr/include/audio/Amd.h
	/usr/include/audio/Aos.h

III.  Using the Network Audio System

Now that you have things built, you can use the Network Audio System
as follows:

	%  ausun -aa &		# -aa allows any host access
	%  setenv AUDIOSERVER `hostname`:0
	%  auinfo
	%  audemo examples/sounds
	%  ...

If you are using it over the network, the shorthand syntax for specifying an
audio server is hostname:0.  Access control is still a bit primitive....

				 *  *  *  *  *

IV.  Using the Network Audio System with Sun Deskset

The "autool" program can be used as a replacement for audiotool.  This
allows Sun Deskset applications (e.g. mailtool, etc.) to be used with
the Network Audio System.  See the autool man page
(clients/audio/autool/autool.man) for details on how to configure
Deskset.

				 *  *  *  *  *

V.  Games

Well, now that you have networked audio, it's time to actually use it
for something.  XBoing and xpilot are both distributed with Network
Audio System support.  Check ftp.x.org:/contrib/audio/nas/contrib for
other applications that support the Network Audio System.

				 *  *  *  *  *

VI.  Finding Sounds to Play With

Users with some versions of SunOS can find a number of audio files to
listen to in /usr/demo/SOUND/sounds/.  Once the Network Audio System
is running, they can be examined using:

	%  audemo /usr/demo/SOUND/sounds

A separate tar archive called sounds.tar.Z is available from ftp.x.org.

For the true audio packrat, there are a number of anonymous ftp sites that
contain archives of thousands of sound bites.  The "Sound Site Newsletter"
published periodically on comp.sys.ibm.pc.soundcard, comp.sys.ibm.pc.misc, and
rec.games.misc contains a detailed list of machines, bulletin boards, etc.

				 *  *  *  *  *

VII.  For More Information

We've set up a mailing list for folks who are working with the Network
Audio System:

    nas@ncd.com			General discussion of the Network
				Audio System; anyone who who will
				actively participate is welcome to
				join.

    nas-request@ncd.com		Where to send requests to get on or off the
				mailing list.


The Network Audio System has benefited greatly from the testing and
contributions of many people on the mailing list.  We'd like to thank
them for their help and encourage everyone to participate in the
on-going development process.

We hope you enjoy the Network Audio System.  There're still a few
pieces to be added, but already a significant number of hardware and
software vendors are finding that it solves their problems.  Besides,
you can't beat the price!  :-)
