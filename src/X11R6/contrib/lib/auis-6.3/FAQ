Andrew Consortium
Frequently Asked Questions
Release 6.2

Last Update:  3/16/94

 This file contains questions from everywhere and answers from many
places.  The sections on General Information and Common Problems
Building Andrew were compiled by Susan Straub (susan+@andrew.cmu.edu). 
The section on User Questions has been extracted from a larger FAQ for
CMU maintained by Andrew Plotkin (ap1i+@andrew.cmu.edu).  

FIle and pathnames beginning with ./ are references to files in the AUIS
sources;  names of installed files begin with $ANDREWDIR.
All patches assume you are in the top-level source directory, that is,
the directory with subdirectories atk, ams, atkams, config, overhead,
and so on.  You can send suggestions and comments to the consortium's
mailing list/newsgroup:  

	info-andrew@andrew.cmu.edu.

Send bug reports to:

	info-andrew-bugs@andrew.cmu.edu

General Questions

G1.  What is Andrew?
    The Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a portable
    user-interface toolkit that runs under X11. It provides a
    dynamically-loadable object-oriented environment wherein objects
    can be embedded in one-another. Thus, one could use our
    'generic-object' editor (ez) to edit text that, in addition to
    containing multiple fonts, contains embedded raster images,
    spreadsheets, drawing editors, equations, simple animations,
    etc.. These embedded objects could themselves contain other
    objects, including text. With the toolkit, programmers can
    create new objects that can be embedded as easily as those that
    come with the system. Many objects, including those mentioned
    above, along with a help system, a system monitoring tool
    (console), an editor based shell interface (typescript), and
    support for printing multi-media documents, are included in the
    release, making it useful to programmers and non-programmers
    alike. 

    The Andrew Message System(AMS) provides a multi-media interface
    to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS contains many advanced 
    features including authentication, return receipts, automatic
    sorting of mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures,
    audit trails of related messages, and subscription management.
    It also provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and
    low-function personal computers in addition to the high-function
    workstations. 

G2.  How do I obtain the latest release?

    This release, 6.2, can be obtained in several ways.   Andrew, as
    well as a variety of CMU software and the latest patches, is
    available via anonymous ftp from the Internet host,
    ftp.andrew.cmu.edu (Internet: 128.2.232.154).   Due to its size,
    the compressed tar'd tree is split into 5 files, auis{1,2,3},
    contrib and doc in the dist-6.2/ directory.    You should
    uncompress and tar -xvf each file individually.   The
    distribution is also available via anonymous ftp from the
    Internet host ftp.x.org (Internet address:  (198.112.44.100)). 
    The sources are located in the contrib/andrew tree.   

    Release 6.2 is a beta version of that which will be made
    available on the X.V11R6 contrib tape.  You should grab that
    release when it becomes available.

    NOTE:  The version of Andrew that is located in the
    ./pub/R5/contrib-3 directory on the X.V11R5 tape is Release 5.0.
      Since the Consortium supports only the latest release, please
    do not use that release.    Thank you.  

G3.  Which platforms has Andrew been ported to?

The (intended) available machine types are:

    SCO                         SCO                             sco_i386

G4.  What books have been written for Andrew and where can I obtain them?

    Nathaniel S. Borenstein's book: Multimedia Applications
    Development with the Andrew Toolkit (Prentice-Hall).

    ODA Project Book: Multi-media Document Interchange: ODA and the
    EXPRES Project (Springer Verlag).

G5.  What is the Andrew Remote Demo Service?  

    This network service allows you to run Andrew Toolkit
    applications without the overhead of obtaining or compiling the
    Andrew software.  The Remote Andrew Demo service will have you
    running Andrew software within 5 minutes.

    You need a host machine on the Internet, and you need to be
    running the X11 window system.  A simple "finger" command will
    allow you to experience ATK applications firsthand.  You'll be
    able to compose multimedia documents, navigate through the
    interactive Andrew Tour, and use the Andrew Message System to
    browse through CMU's three thousand bulletin boards and
    newsgroups.

    HOW TO USE THE SERVICE

    To use the Remote Andrew Demo service, run the following command
    on your machine:

        finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu

    The service will give you any further instructions that may be
    necessary.

G6.  What is the Andrew Consortium and what benefits do the members receive?

    The principal activity of the Andrew Consortium is to maintain
    the central sources for AUIS.   Improvements and enhancments
    from many organizations are gathered together for
    redistribution;  frequently to members and more-or-less annually
    to others via the X Consortium distribution channel. 
    Programming support and consultation are available to full
    members.  The Consortium also organizes an annual technical
    meeting, publishes a newsletter, and maintains the info-andrew
    mailing list on the internet. Organizations are invited to
    become members of the Consortium.  A variety of levels of
    membership are available ranging from nominal to fully
    supportive.

G7.   Will there be the restrictions on distributing non-source
applications that may be developed?  

    There are two flavors of release:  the "current" software
    distributed on a timely basis to members and the occasional
    release via the X consortium.  The latter is virtually
    unrestricted and anyone can distribute applications based on it
    to anyone.  The current software is subject to license
    restrictions;  contributing and full members can distribute
    applications based on the current software.  Associate members
    can build applications on the current software and release them
    internally and to other consortium members of any class.  To
    more generally release applications, an associate member would
    build them on top of the current software and then release them
    on top of the next X release.

G8.  What are the restrictions on non-members who develop using the X
Consortium distribution?

    The only restrictions are that they cannot use the names of IBM,
    CMU, and other contributors in their advertising, and they
    cannot sue any contributors.  Otherwise they can create and sell
    software based on the X release.

    One advantage of associate membership is to get access to the
    current software so that when the application is ready it can be
    released on top of the latest ATK rather than an old one.

Common Problems/Questions Building Andrew
Building AUIS

B1.  Why doesn't my macro expand in site.mcr?

    You probably used a tab in your site.mcr file instead of spaces. 
    Tabs are not allowed before macro declarations in the site.mcr. 
    Although the error is not reported as such, the macro is not
    expanded properly and thus not noticed by imake.  Use spaces.  

B2. Why does the distribution as made available on MIT's X.V11R5 tape
install files as links instead of actual files?  This fails in two
directories:  overhead/class/lib and xmkfontd.  

    The distribution defaults to install links instead of files.  To
    change this, #undef LINKINSTALL_ENV in your site.h file.   If you
    want to build using LINKINSTALL_ENV, you will have to change the
    following two files: 

    overhead/class/lib/Imakefile:

        29,32d28
        < #ifdef LIBDL_ENV
        < install.time:: libclass.a
        <       $(INSTALL) $(INSTLIBFLAGS) libclass.a $(DESTDIR)/lib
        < #else /* LIBDL_ENV */
        34d29
        < #endif /* LIBDL_ENV */

    xmkfontd/Imakefile:

        18c18
        <       $(INSTALL)  ${INSTLIBFLAGS} non-andrew.fonts.alias 
        ${DESTDIR}/X11fonts/fonts.alias 
        ---
        > InstallFileToFile(non-andrew.fonts.alias, ${INSTLIBFLAGS},
        ${DESTDIR}/X11fonts/fonts.alias)


B3.  Which configuration variables are used most often? 

    AFS30_ENV
    AFS31_ENV 
    AMS_DELIVERY_ENV 
    WHITEPAGES_ENV 
    SNAP_ENV 
    ANDREW_MALLOC_ENV
    DEBUG_MALLOC_ENV
    MK_BASIC_UTILS
    MK_AUTHORING 
    MK_AUX_UTILS 
    MK_AUX_INSETS
    MK_EXAMPLES 
    RUN_AMDS_ENV
    ANDREW_PRINTING_ENV
    LINKINSTALL_ENV
    CONTRIB_ENV 
    PRE_X11R4_ENV 
    DPS_ENV 
    DEFAULT_ANDREWDIR_ENV 
    BUILDANDREWINSTALL_ENV 
    ISO80_FONTS_ENV     
    FONTS_TO_PCF_ENV

    CDEBUGFLAGS = -g
    MAKEDODEBUG = -g
    AFSBASEDIR = /usr/local
    XMKFONTDIR = /usr/local/bin/mkfontdir
    XFC = /usr/local/bin/bdftosnf
    XLIBDIR = /usr/local/lib
    XINCDIR = /usr/local/include
    RESOLVLIB = ${AFSBASEDIR}/lib/res/libresolv.a
    RESINC = -I$(AFSBASEDIR)/include/res
    INCLUDES =  -I${BASEDIR}/include -I$(BASEDIR)/include/atk $(RESINC)
    -I$(AFSBASEDIR)/include -I${XINCDIR}

B4.  Should I modify the Imakefile or the Makefile?  
    Changes should never be made to the Makefile. All changes should be
    made to Imakefile; "make Makefile" to regenerate that one file, or
    "make Makefiles" to regenerate the Makefiles in all subdirectories,
    recursively.

    "make clean" and "make Clean" do not delete the Makefile, so a
    subsequent "make Makefile" says it is up to date, i.e., comparing
    its own timestamp against itself. Beware: once you remove the
    Makefile from a directory, you can't say "make Makefile" there
    again, You can, however, rename Makefile to another name and say
    "make Makefile -f newname". 

B5.  Some parts of the ./contrib section will not build under Linux. 
Are patches forthcoming? 

    The ./contrib/gestures and ./contrib/tm directories do not build
    under Linux as of Release 6.2.  

    Also, there are problems building the ./contrib/mit/rtf2 and
    ./contrib/mit/2rtf directories.  A patch was applied to hopefully
    remedy the problem but since the Consortium does not have a Linux
    system on which to test, we were not able to check if the fix really
    works.  

    A notice will be sent to the info-andrew distribution list once
    patches are available for these problems.  

Binary Distributions

D1.  What binary distributions are available?  

    A binary distribution of AUIS 6.1 for Linux is available in
    ftp:/pub/Linux/X11/andrew on sunsite.unc.edu.  A Linux binary
    distribution of Release 6.2 will be made available soon.  Look for
    an announcement from the info-andrew distribution list. 

    Binary distributions are also available for Release 5.2.1, the
    CD-ROM Release for the following system types: 

    hp700_80    pmax_ul4      sun4c_411     rs_aix31

    These are available from the Consortium ftp server,
    ftp.andrew.cmu.edu, IP 128.2.35.66.  Since these binaries are now
    outdated by the lastest release, we are planning to remove them
    soon.  At this time, we have no plans to provide future binary
    distributions other than those provided by other netters.  

D2.  What are the FAQs for these binary distributions?  

    For help problems with the sunsite.unc.edu Linux distribution, see
    the L3.  "Why can't the help program find any help file"?. 

    Another common problem with the sunsite distribution is that the
    cursor is only a little white dot on some boxes.  We think this
    might be an X server but or possibly a  limitation on the size of
    the cursor.  If it is a size limit you can try picking up
    afonts.tar.Z by anonymous ftp from atk.itc.cmu.edu.  Instructions
    for using them follow: 

        1.  Make a directory where you will place the fonts.  Cd to that
    directory.
        2.  Run "ftp atk.itc.cmu.edu".  When asked for your login name,
    respond with "anonymous".  When asked for your password, respond
    with your ordinary user-id.
        3.  Place ftp into binary file transfer mode with the command "binary".
        4.  Run the ftp command "get afonts.tar.Z".  Depending on the
    speed of the connection, this can take anywhere between a few
    seconds to a few minutes.
        5.  Quit ftp with "quit".
        6.  Extract the font files from afonts.tar.Z with the command
    "uncompress < afonts.tar.Z | tar xf -".
        6a. [If you are running a version of X11 earlier than release 4,
    you may need to compile the bdf-style font files with "bdftosnf",
    then run "mkfontdir".  Consult your local documentation.]
        7.  Place the current directory in your font path with the
    command "xset fp+ /directory/name/here/".  Be sure to include the
    trailing /.

Messages/Mail

M1.  How can I instruct messages to use /usr/spool/mail for mail drop?

    Although the following lines are in /usr/andrew/etc/AndrewSetup:

        AMS_NonAMSDelivery: yes
        AMS_MailBoxPrefix: /usr/spool/mail

    Messages says, "/usr/user/Mailbox" could not be properly read and
>     delivered (0 success, 0 failure)". 

    You should create a file $HOME/.mailrc and put in this line:

        unset hold

    WARNING:  Once you start reading mail with messages, your incoming
    mail will be stored within directories maintained by messages.  It
    is possible to return to other mail handling systems, but it may not
    be easy.


M2.  When using UCB sendmail, are aliases in /usr/lib/aliases case-sensitive?  

    If you build your UCB sendmail with the ``DBM'' option set, aliases
    in /usr/lib/aliases are case-sensitive; if you build it without that
    option, they're case-insensitive. For purposes of validating user
    names, AMS assumes that aliases in /usr/lib/aliases are
    case-insensitive. This might mean that a name that validates OK with
    AMS might be rejected by UCB sendmail, if that sendmail uses DBM to
    do its alias lookup.

M3.  Why isn't queuemail installed automatically?  

    Queuemail wants to be installed setuid-daemon, and the Andrew
    installation mechanism assumes that it can't do that.  The
    installation is omitted, albeit silently, and must be done by
    hand.  

AFS

A1.  Why do I get errors when building Ultrix 4.2 against AFS 3.1 libraries? 

    You need to define AFS_ULTRIX in your site.h file.  

A2.  Do I need to have AFS to run the Andrew Message System (AMS)?

    No, but having AFS gives you better functionality.   

    Public bboards and mail are no problem, but AMS is not smart enough
    about UNIX groups to do private bboards right.  

A3.  What is AFS and how can I get more information?  

    AFS is a distributed file system available from Transarc
    Corporation. For more information, please send email to
    afs-sales+@transarc.com or snail mail to:  
    Transarc Corporation
    The Gulf Tower
    707 Grant Street
    Pittsburgh, PA  15219
    +1 412 338 4400 

Adjunct Software

S1.  How can I get other useful software?

    Enormous quantities of software are available for free from the
    internet.  Many of the pieces are also available via electronic
    mail.  Subsequent paragraphs list some software that may be of value
    as an adjunct to ATK/AMS.

archie - archive locator
    A major source of information about the location of software on the
    network is 'archie'.  Send mail to 
        archie@archie.rutgers.edu
    In the body of the message include line(s) of the form
        prog   name
    where name is the name of the software you would like to find out
    about.  For more information, the body can contain the line
        help
    The listing returned from a 'prog' request will list ftp sites
    containing information with the name you gave.  A site with a name
    ending in .com, .edu, or .gov will be in the United States and will
    be the best place to try.

ftp - file transfer package
    To retrieve information via ftp over the internet:  Give the command 
        ftp <site name>
    The response will ask for your login;  reply
        anonymous
    the response will ask for your email address;  type it in.  Now you
    can give the help command to see the commands.  I generally use ls,
    dir, cd, lcd, pwd, and get.

on the ATK cd-rom
    Some useful non-ATK software is included in the ATK cd-rom.  For
    details see subsequent paragraphs.

S2.  How can I use PostScript fonts other than those defined in
/usr/andrew/X11fonts both in displayed and printed documents?

    There are two aspects of this problem: screen display and print
    display.

    Screen Display: 

    To have your own fonts used by ATK applications for displaying
    text you must first create those fonts and place them in a
    directory, possibly set up a fonts.alias file, run mkfontdir to
    get a fonts.dir file, and finally add that directory to your X
    fontpath.  Also, you'll have to specify in your preferences file
    the fontname:

    ez.bodyfont: myfont12

        Print Display: 

    To get these fonts to print you have to create the appropriate troff
    device-specific font description files (see /usr/lib/font/devpsc for
    the Postscript fonts).  Question: Are there tools around that let
    you create a troff font? Furthermore, you'd have to alter the
    ATK-to-troff text translator (../andrew/atk/text/txtroff.c) to
    recognize your new font family and to make the appropriate mapping
    from your fontname to the troff fontname.  Currently, the only fonts
    used for printing are Times, Helvetica, and Courier.

S3.  How do I use the spell checker function in ez?  

    If ispell, the spelling checker used by ez, is not available at your
    site or is not along your path, ez will not be able to perform this
    function. ispell is widely available (e.g. via anonymous FTP off of
    uunet.uu.net). All an installer has to do to get ez spell checking
    to work is to install ispell somewhere along the user's path. The
    following .atkinit line will then be useful:

        addmenu "spell-check-document" "Search/Spell~1,Check
        Spelling~30" textview

    You should try to find either ispell version 2.0.02 or the newer
    version 3.0.09. (As of Jan 1994, 3.0.09 can be FTP'd from
    ftp.cs.ucla.edu, in /pub/ispell.) 
    This is because ispell version 4.0 (the version released by the FSF)
    is missing a few features. If you use the standard distribution of
    ispell 4.0, ez will not be able to add words to your private
    dictionary, or accept words for the rest of the session. 

    If you wish to use ispell 4.0 anyway, the following patch will add
    the required functionality. (Use this only on ispell 4.0, not any
    other version.) If you recompile ispell 4.0 with this patch, ATK
    will use it and work correctly. The patched ispell must, of course,
    be earlier than any other version of ispell in your shell path.

    -------------------------------------
    This patch has been submitted to to FSF, but they have not yet released it.

S4.  How do I debug Andrew applications?  

    In order to debug ATK applications you will need to have gdb version
    3.5 or greater from the Free Software Foundation.    See Q11, How
    can I get other useful software? above for information on how to
    contact the FSF.  

    To compile the system such that symbol tables exist add these two
    lines to your site.mcr:

            CDEBUGFLAGS = -g
            MAKEDODEBUG = -g

    To debug the raster application you would first load the
    statically-linked portion of the ATK run-time system, called runapp,
    into gdb. It is important that the above make.1 macros are set to
    include the -g switch so that the symbol table is created. There is
    no use attempting to use gdb if the system has not been built with
    the -g switch.

    % gdb runapp

    done.
    Type "help" for a list of commands.
    (gdb) run -d ezapp foo.ras -d
    Starting program: runapp -d ezapp foo.ras -d
    Starting ez (Version 7.0, ATK 15.0); please wait...
     raster: text = 0x10046594  data = 0x10049280  entry = 0x100498a8
     rasterview: text = 0x1004f820  data = 0x1005cc60  entry = 0x1005f8d8
     rasterimage: text = 0x1006701c  data = 0x100675d0  entry = 0x10067810
     pixelimage: text = 0x1006e758  data = 0x100703bc  entry = 0x1007068c

    To load the symbol table for the raster dynamic object you would use
    this command on a Sun or a DECstation 3100[An Andrew ToolKit view (a
    footnote) was included here, but could not be displayed.]:
    (gdb) add-file raster.dog 0x10046594

    and on an RT:
    (gdb) set-rel 0x10046594
    (gdb) add-file raster.dog

    Note that the addresses passed to these gdb commands come from the
    text address that runapp outputs when the -d switch is used (the
    second -d switch prevents runapp from forking itself to become an
    orphaned process). To determine which module to load in the fashion
    described above compare the various text addresses with the address
    at which the program failed. For example, if the program died at
    address 0x1004a520 you would find that address between what was
    reported as the start of the text segments for raster and
    rasterview. Since the raster module was loaded first, we can
    conclude that the failure was somewhere in the raster module.

S5.  Why can't ez find ispell when I know it's installed? 

    Ispell must be on your path in order for ez to find it.  

Printing

P1. How can I print Andrew documents?

    Printing requires two steps, text formatting and then driving the
    printer.  ATK utilizes troff for text formatting.  That is adequate
    for printing documents with styled texts, but some insets such as
    rasters and zip require that the printer be driven with PostScript.

    Print processing is controlled via the FormatCommand and
    PrintCommand options, which can be specified in site.h during system
    build, the global preferences in $ANDREWDIR/lib/global.prf, or the
    user's ~/preferences file.  The most general defaults are:
        *.FormatCommand: eqn -Tpsc /tmp/%s.n  | troff -Tpsc - |
        *.PrintCommand: lpr -n
    The -Tpsc flags specify that the troff output is ultimately intended
    for a PostScript printer.  If you do not have one, this value must
    be set to whatever is appropriate for your printer.  ATK documents
    containing only styled text can be printed via most versions of
    troff and most print drivers.

    To print ATK documents via PostScript printers, you have three options:
        troff - psroff
        ditroff - psdit
        groff
    These differ in cost and the difficulty of installation.  See Q8 for
    hints on acquiring these packages.

    troff - psroff
    Standard Unix systems are often delivered with an old troff which
    generates output for the "CAT" typesetter.  This troff can be used
    to print ATK documents by sending the output through the psroff
    processor, available freely on the internet.  See the psroff
    documentation.

    ditroff - psdit
    This is the route we use at CMU.  ditroff is the device independent
    troff which comes with the Documenters Work Bench portion of Unix
    System V.  psdit is part of the "Transcript" package available from
    Adobe software.  Both ditroff and Transcript cost money.  Adjust the
    FormatCommand to utilize the ditroff version of troff (it is usually
    called troff).  The PrintCommand should usually use the -n switch
    and the lpr daemon will run psdit.

    Ditroff is part of the Documenter's WorkBench (DWB) which is under
    development by AT&T.  Universities can get source code, but others
    may have to get binaries.  The AT&T manager for DWB is Peter Nelson,
    908 582 6078.

    groff 
    This package is free from the Free Software Foundation, the gnu
    people.  The only hitch is that to build groff you must first build
    g++ and to build g++ you must first build gcc.  We have compiled
    groff without any problems with g++-1.39.1. g++ also compiled gpic,
    geqn, gtbl.   

    Groff includes gtroff to do text formatting and grops to generate
    PostScript.  To To use both, have this specification:
        *.formatcommand:      groff -pte -E /tmp/%s.n |
        *.PrintCommand: lpr -v
    Note:  The -pte switches tell it to run gpic, gtbl, and geqn before
    running gtroff.  The output of gtroff is automatically piped into
    grops, which generates the PostScript.  (This assumes that
    /usr/gnu/bin (or wherever groff is installed) is on one's path.)

    The drawback of this simple approach is that the ATK preview option
    will no longer work.  To retain the preview command, I believe, one
    can use specifications something like this:
        *.FormatCommand: 
        *.PreviewCommand: groff -pteZ -TX100 /tmp/%s.n | preview -f -o %s
        *.PrintCommand: groff -pte -E /tmp/%s.n | lpr -v

    (You may want to use X75 if your display is closer to 75 dpi that 100dpi.)


P2.  Ezprint outputs rasters in PostScript.  Can I print those rasters?

    If you just want to print one raster from an Andrew document, you
    can extract the raster from the troff output with a raw text editor
    and print it directly.  You may have to add the line
        20 20 translate
    to get it out of the bottom corner.  You may also have to add an
    initial line containing only 
        %!

    If you haven't got a postscript printer, the raster image can still
    be massaged with the pbm package.  pbm understands the Andrew format
    or you can use the output of 
        ezprint -t <file>
    which will include the raster encoded in PostScript / hex form.

Applications

L1.  How can I fix the error message in my console about <getstats/gvm>
Cannot open /dev/kmem?

    You may see the following error message: 

        |>> console:<getstats/gvm> Cannot open /dev/kmem - will not
        monitor Disk and GVMStats <<| 
        console: ->> Try 'Restart Stats' Menu <<

    If you get this message, your ``getstats'' program (installed from
    atk/console/stats/common) wasn't installed with sufficient privilege
    to be able to open /dev/kmem. This happens because your /dev/kmem is
    protected against global reading, but you didn't do an Andrew
    installation from an account with enough privilege to install
    ``getstats'' set-uid or set-gid. One possibility for this is that
    you are running AFS, but you didn't turn the AFS flag on for the
    compilation. In order for console to monitor information available
    only through /dev/kmem, you'll have to do the following: 

        cd ..../atk/console/stats/common
        su admin (or su root)
        chmod 4555 getstats

    We have not included any consoles specifically tailored to a
    non-AMDS, non-AFS environment. We hope to have some available in
    future patch distributions. 

L2.  I get the following error in my console:  <appname>X error
BadValue, integer parameter out of range ...  How can I fix this?  

    Some users do not remember to run mkfontdir in the
    ${DESTDIR}/X11fonts directory after the dependInstall operation is
    complete. If you do not do so, you will see an error message similar
    to the following: 

        <appname>X error BadValue, integer parameter out of range ...

    Running on HP-UX, you may see problems with the fonts. A possible
    workaround for the font problem is to change the bodyfont font
    preference in your preferences file to some font that is in the X
    default font path. 

    Some formulation of the bdf files causes either convertfont or the
    window system to miscount the position of the glyphs in the font.
    This means that the window system doesn't believe that you have
    glyphs for lower-case characters. 

    The distributed Andrew fonts are tailored for about 80 pixels to the
    inch. By default these are not used, since for workstations with
    other resolutions it is generally best to utilize the X fonts
    instead. See the discussion of ISO80_FONTS_ENV above.

L3.  Why can't the help program find any help files?

	Using a tree built from source: 

    If help files cannot be found or the alias database is missing, the
    following make operations from the root of the object tree may help:

        make dependInstall SUBDIRS='helpindex'

    These operations can be repeated as desired.

    Using a Release 5.2.1 binary distribution or running off the CDROM: 

    If you are running from the CDROM or are using the binary
    distribution available on the Consortium ftp server,
    ftp.andrew.cmu.edu, the solution is different.  The problem with
    help may have resulted because the tree was moved to a different
    location than where help is trying to find
    $ANDREWDIR/lib/help.index.  The indices map a help topic to a
    filename for the associated help file.  Since we provide binaries
    now, people are free to place the distribution anywhere, and this
    invalidates the filenames recorded in the indices.

    There are two ways to solve the problem:

    1) create an AndrewSetup file (/etc/AndrewSetup) and add this line:

    HelpIndexDir: $ANDREWDIR/lib/help.index

    Replace "$ANDREWDIR" above with the actual value for ANDREWDIR.

    2) Use the INDEXER script from the top-level SCRIPTS directory to
    rebuild the indices.  You would execute the INDEXER this way:

    % INDEXER -D $ANDREWDIR/lib/help.index

    You can use the INDEXER to build alternate sets of help indices.
    If you don't re-build the indices "in place", then you'll still
    need to add a HelpIndexDir line to your AndrewSetup file.

    Using a Release 6.1 Binary Distribution for Linux: 

    A binary distribution of AUIS 6.1 is available in
    ftp:/pub/Linux/X11/andrew on sunsite.unc.edu.  One of the known
    problems with this distribution is that the help application will
    not work if you do not also install andrew61.prog.tar.gz, which is
    where the help.index directory is located.    

Fonts

F1.  I'm not getting the right fonts.

    When building Andrew from sources, fonts are not being installed
    properly.  There is a bug in the file ./xmkfontd/Imakefile that
    erroneously removes the $ANDREWDIR/X11fonts/fonts.alias file
    without re-installing it.  An informal patch follows.

      #else  /* ISO80_FONTS_ENV */
      #ifdef SCOunix
      #ifdef FONTS_TO_PCF_ENV

F2. When using my NCD X terminal, sometimes text gets rendered in a
scrambled way.

    The problem is fixed in the latest release of the NCD servers. 
    The problem exists in NCD 2.2.0 and does not exist in release
    2.4.x. 

F3. When I run Andrew applications on a remote X server, I get the wrong
fonts or cursors.

        ATK applications attempt to set the X font path correctly,
    to pick up all the special fonts used for cursors and whatnot.
    However, if the X server and the ATK application are running on
    different machines, this may get confused. If so, you will have
    to set the font path yourself.
        The most important fonts are: icon12 (for cursors), shape10
    and xshape10 (for grey shading). The basic Andrew text fonts
    have names starting with tim, hel, and sym (Times, Helvetica,
    and Symbol). Other significant fonts are con10 and con12 (used
    by Console), msgs10 and msgs14 (used by Messages). 
        These are often installed in $ANDREWDIR/X11fonts, but may be
    in /usr/local/fonts or elsewhere, depending on how your site is
    configured. The filenames to look for will be the same as the
    font names, except that icon12 may be called icn16x16. Most
    likely these files will have .pcf extensions, but they may be
    installed as .bdf or some other format appropriate to your X
    server.
        The directory on the server machine which contains those
    font files should be added to the X font path. Use the command 
        xset fp+ /directory/name/here/
        Be sure to include the / at the end. 
        Once this is done, Andrew applications should run properly
    on that X server. The only possible remaining difficulty is that
    if you are using the "CacheShades" preference, the X server will
    have cached invalid grey-shades from the original (invalid) font
    path. Type
        xprop -remove ATK_SHADES -root
    to clear them out; they will be stored correctly once ATK runs
    with the proper font path.

        If you are absolutely unable to find the proper fonts, the
    critical ones can be downloaded from our FTP site. Type
        finger font-help@atk.itc.cmu.edu
    for instructions.

User Questions

U0. Introduction

This section has been extracted from a larger FAQ file maintained at CMU
by Andrew Plotkin  (ap1i+@andrew.cmu.edu).  Its permission information
reads:

    Everything in this file is public domain. You can copy it, mail
    it to people, put bits of it in other files, print it out in
    500-point type and staple it to the walls, whatever you want --
    I'm happy to give you the opportunity, and I couldn't do a thing
    about it if I wanted to.

    Thanks to the multiple people who provided me with questions and
    answers.


U1. Customizing your account

How can I customize my Andrew account?
    For info on your preferences file:
        help preferences   (or help prefs)

I edited my .cshrc, but now I get strange errors when I start typescript, or
I edited my .login, but now I get strange errors when I log in, or
I edited my .plan, but now I get strange symbols when I finger myself, or
I edited my .Xresources, but now I get strange errors when I start X, or
I edited this file, but now I get strange errors....
    If you use ez to edit your .plan, .login, .logout, preferences,
    .cshrc, .Xresources, .Xclients, .Xmodmap, .signature, or any file
    like that: you must get rid of any styles you put in. You can't have
    sections of bold, or typewriter, or italics, or different text
    sizes, or indentation. (Not even in your .plan file or .signature,
    although that would be nice.) Use "Plainest" on the whole file if
    you have to.


U2. Playing with ATK things

How do I customize an ATK program?
    See the help file on it. The ATK help files are more friendly than
    average; lots of examples, no words over two syllables, etc.

How do I change the behavior, fonts, and so on in ATK windows and menus?
    Most of these are controlled by preferences:
        help preferences
        help menubar
    The lines described in these help files go in your preferences file.
    For example, 
        *.Thumbscroll: yes
    will cause the text in any ATK window to swoop up and down when you
    wiggle the scroll bar.
        typescript.Thumbscroll: yes
    will cause that to happen only in typescript windows.

    A major exception is the appearance of the pop-up menus you get when
    you press and hold the middle button. These are controlled by X
    resources (when you are running X.)
        help cmenu
    The resources described in this help file go in your .Xresources file. 
        *TitleFont: andysans22b
    will cause your menu card titles to be printed in a 22-point bold
    sans-serif font. 
        help*TitleFont: andysans22b
    will cause that to happen only in help windows.
    (Notice the format of an .Xresources entry is different from a
    preferences entry.)

I have a color display.  Can I get windows in colors other than black
and white?
    Yes, set the colors in your preference file with lines like this:

        # darker blue on lighter tan.  tan good.  (blue not really dark enough)
        ez.foregroundcolor: #003ea2
        ez.backgroundcolor: wheat

    For colors you can run xcolorpick or edit the file
    /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt.   Color names are recognized by X only if they
    are in rgb.txt.
    If you want colors just for one execution of a program, you can set
    them on the command line:
        typescript -fg black -bg burlywood

    Here's a technique for setting color preferences based on the value
    of the environment variable ISCOLOR, which you can set in your
    .login file as follows:  

        set TTY = `tty`
        if ($TTY == /dev/console || \
                $TTY == /dev/hft/0 || \
                $TTY == /dev/ttyaed || \
                $TTY == /dev/ttyapa16 || \
                $TTY == /dev/ttyap16 || \
                $TTY == /dev/tty8514 || \
                $TTY == /dev/pty/ttyse || \
                $TTY == /dev/ttymono) then
                set consolelogin = 1
                echo -n "Color display? [y/n]: "
                set answer = $<
                if ($answer" =~ [Yy]*) then
                        setenv ISCOLOR 1
                        echo "color console login"
                else
                        echo "console login"
                endif
                unset answer
        endif

    You can then reference this variable in your preferences file: 

        ?E=ISCOLOR=1:ez.backgroundcolor: antiquewhite1
        ?E=ISCOLOR=1:console.backgroundcolor: cornsilk
        ?E=ISCOLOR=1:typescript.backgroundcolor: cornsilk3
        ?E=ISCOLOR=1:help.backgroundcolor: cornsilk3
        ?E=ISCOLOR=1:messages.backgroundcolor: cornsilk2
        ?E=ISCOLOR=1:bush.backgroundcolor: #e5d7c6

How do I add styles to ATK documents?
    	help ez-styles

How do I add tables of contents and footnotes to ATK documents?
    	help ez-contents
        help ez-footnotes

How do I adjust line spacing and margins in ATK documents?
    	help ez
    and scroll down to "Formatting text: line spacing and margins".

What keystroke commands work in ATK programs?
    	help ez-keys
    Notice that most gnu-emacs keys work in ATK programs. 

How do I work with multiple ez windows or multiple buffers?
    	help ez-buffers

How do I remove ATK formatting from an ATK document, to turn it into
plain text?
    The easy way is to edit it with ez, select (highlight) the entire
    document, and select "Plainest". 
    This will not work if the document has pagebreaks, footnotes, or
    insets (such as embedded rasters.)
    If you don't want to start up ez, you can use ez2ascii:
        ez2ascii filename

    Another alternative is to type
        rtfm -f filename
    This produces output with terminal formatting. It will look ok in an
    xterm, and underlining and boldface will show up correctly. However,
    it will fail nastily in a typescript, or if you put the output in a
    file and edit it. 

    For more info, see
        help ez2ascii
        help rtfm

How can I write my own console layout?
    	help lacc
    The publically-available console layouts are in
    /usr/local/lib/consoles. If you want to write your own, it's best to
    start with one of these and modify it.

    Once you've written your console layout file, add this line to your
    preferences:
        console.default: consolefilename
    where consolefile is a full pathname (no ~'s), for example
    /afs/andrew/usr99/userid/layoutfile

What is a help search path?
    Look at
        help preferences
    and scroll down to "Help preferences." (Redundant, aren't I? And
    repetitive.)
    The default help search path includes the help directories for all
    the standard Andrew programs, and everything in /usr/contributed. To
    add, for example, the help directory for the Computer Club's
    programs, you would add this line to your preferences:
        help.searchpath: /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr0/cl0x/man
    If you have more than one directory in this line, they should be
    separated by colons, not spaces.

    The search path is read in when you start help. If help is already
    running, you can add a directory to the search path by choosing "Add
    Search Directory" from the menu. This change is only temporary and
    will go away when you quit help. To permanently add a directory, you
    have to put it in your preferences.


U3.  Mail and bboards

How do I set options for messages?
    Select "Set Options" on the "Other" menu card. This will bring up a
    long list of options where the message titles usually are, and
    explanations and switches where the message bodies usually are. You
    can scroll through either list, and click on the switches to change
    things. (Some of these changes take effect immediately; for others,
    you have to quit and restart messages.) 
    There are a few, more obscure, options that you can set in your
    preferences file. Type
        help preferences
    and scroll down to "Andrew Messages System preferences". 


U4. Strange file formats

How do I convert rasters, bitmaps, or images from one type to another?
    To convert old-style ATK rasters (.ras) to new-style ATK rasters
    (.raster) or vice-versa,
        help convertraster
    convertraster claims to be able to convert MacPaint files that you
    have ftp'd to Andrew. This may not be reliable.
    To convert other image types, including X bitmaps, MacPaint files,
    and GIFs, 
        help pbm
        help pnm
    and also see the help files on all the little programs they mention.

    Some notes:
        PBM, PPM, and PGM are special image file formats which are
    designed to be "intermediate" conversion formats. That is, you can
    convert anything to these formats, and then convert it to anything
    else.
        PBM ("portable bitmap") is for simple black-and-white images
    like those produced by MacPaint or bitmap. PGM ("portable greymap")
    is for images with shades of grey, and PPM ("portable pixmap") is
    for full-color images. PNM ("portable any-map") is not a file
    format; a program called "pnm-something" can handle PBM, PPM, or PGM
    files.
        PBM, PGM, and PPM can be interconverted with the appropriate
    programs (ppmtopgm, pgmtopbm.) Both of these lose information, of
    course: ppmtopgm reduces the color image to shades of grey, and
    pgmtopbm changes shades to grey to black-and-white (although it will
    simulate grey by mixing black and white dots.)
        Also, a PGM file can be used whenever a PPM file is expected
    (ie, as input to ppm-something), and a PBM file can be used whenever
    either of the other two formats is expected. This is reasonable,
    since a bitmap is just a greyscale image with only two shades of
    grey, and a greyscale image is just a color image with only grey
    colors.
        All the conversion programs (except convertraster) work as
    filters. See the examples below.
        There are two programs, atobm and bmtoa, which convert X bitmaps
    to and from ASCII files. There are no help files on them.
        The MacPaint to RLE program, painttorle, is not reliable for
    large (full-screen) MacPaint files.
        PostScript files are designed only to be printed, so they're
    hard to convert to any other format. If you want to do that, you
    should view the file with dxpsview and then take a window dump of
    the dxpsview window (which produces an XWD file), and then convert
    that.

    To convert an X bitmap to a PBM file, use
        cat file.bm | xbmtopbm > file.pbm

    To convert a PBM file to an X bitmap file, use
        cat file.pbm | pbmtoxbm > file.bm

    To convert a GIF to PostScript, use
        cat file.gif | giftoppm | ppmtops > file.ps


U5.  Working with graphics and images

What drawing and painting programs are available on Andrew?
    (Drawing programs are the ones like MacDraw, that let you put down
    geometric objects and then move them around, change their sizes, and
    so on. Painting programs, like MacPaint, let you splot paint down on
    a raster, possibly in geometric shapes, and edit it pixel by pixel.)
    There are the ATK versions, zip (drawing) and raster (painting). zip
    is slow and somewhat buggy, and nobody uses it. raster is very
    primitive, and nobody uses it. However, they have the advantage of
    letting you put zip-drawings or rasters into ATK documents along
    with text.
        help zip
        help raster

U6. Fancy key bindings

Some packages commonly used by developers are not normally bound to keys
in order to simplify the user interface.  If you want to bind them, add
the given line to your ~/.atkinit file or to apply the binding just to
application xxx, add the line to ~/.xxxinit.
	help initfiles

How can I execute an arbitrary expression?
    	help ness
    and read
        $ANDREWDIR/doc/atk/ness/nesshack.doc
    The normal binding of this function is ESC-ESC, though some people
    find this too easy to type by mistake (and Ness does take a couple
    of seconds to load the first time it is called).  To get the ESC-ESC
    binding add to your .atkinit the line:
        addkey ness-dostmt  \e\e  view  

What is the "proctable"?
    	help procs
    Menu entries and key sequences are not bound directly to functions
    in C code.  Instead they are bound to routines made available by the
    C code for the various insets.  For instance, the operation on text
    usually bound to ESC-b, which moves the cursor backward by one word,
    is the proctable function textview-backward-word.  When such a
    function is called from Ness, however, the dashes are written as
    underscores: textview_backward_word.  

    How can I find out what is in the proctable?
        help deskey
    The deskey package offers several proctable functions which can be
    bound to keys or menu entries.  My own usage is given by these lines
    in my ~/.atkinit:
        addkey deskey-describe-bound-keys ^XK im
        addkey deskey-describe-proctable ^XP im
    Then control-X-shift-K opens another window showing all the current
    key bindings and control-X-shift-P opens a window showing all
    functions currently in the proctable.  More functions are added to
    the list as more insets are loaded in.

How can I execute an arbitrary proctable function?
    	help metax
    The metax package offers two operations to bind to keys.  They
    prompt for a function to execute and provide name completion by
    examining the proctable for function names.  To bind ESC-x to the
    operation that calls a function without passing an argument add this
    line to .atkinit:
        addkey metax "\ex" view metax

How can I get file name completion in typescript?
    If you are typing a file name to ez, you can get file name
    completion with space and question mark.  The same functionality is
    available in the typescript window, but it is better to bind it to
    other keys.  The following in your .atkinit:
        addkey fcomp-complete-filename "\t" typescript
        addkey fcomp-possible-completions "\e\t" typescript
    will bind TAB so it completes the currently entered file name as far
    as it can and will bind ESC-TAB so it offers a list of all possible
    completions (as a list in the typescript).

Can I perform incremental search as in gnuemacs?
    	help search
        help gsearch
    Yes, three different alternative search packages are available. 
    Dynamic search is described in the help file for search and a
    gnu-emacs clone is described in the gsearch helpfile. 
    (Unfortunately, when you ask for help on 'search', you get the
    gsearch helpfile;  you have to select twice the menu option Show
    More Documentation.)  

    A simplified incremental search package with no documentation can be
    bound with
        addkey incsearch-forward ^S textview
        addkey incsearch-backward ^R textview
    Note that incsearch-forward MUST be bound to ^S or it will do
    backward searches.

How can I convert paragraphs that have hard newlines within them to ATK
paragraphs with newlines only at the ends?
    	read $ANDREWDIR/lib/ness/format.n
    To convert text in messages or DOS files to ATK format, you need to
    wrap the lines.  This can be done with a query replace changing
    newlines to spaces, but this is not always satisfactory because
    multiple spaces are needed after sentence ending punctuation.  When
    you have a binding for ness-dostmt you can use a Ness function. 
    Select the text to be wrapped, type ESC-ESC or your binding for
    ness-dostmt, and then answer the prompt with 
        format_wrap()
    The selected text will be wrapped appropriately.


U7. Programming in Ness and C

Is there a way to bind a keystroke or menu to a simple combination of
other operations?
    You could write a "package" following the model of incremental
    search, but it's lots easier just to write a short Ness function.  
        help ness
    A simple approach is to create a directory ~/nesslib and put in it
    the files--say f.n and g.n--with the Ness functions.  Then in your
    .atkinit or other .XXXinit file, add the lines
        load ness
        call ness-load /usr/you/nesslib/f.n
        call ness-load /usr/you/nesslib/g.n
    Substitute the full path to your nesslib directory.  Do the "load
    ness" line only once.

    Example 1:  Provide a menu operation to start up a typescript. 
    (This was written for a user whose window manager and typescripts
    died often;  if any window was left the user could start a
    typescript.)  The Ness code is:

        extend "view:frame"
                on menu "File,Typescript~85"
                        system("typescript"     -- launch typescript
                                        -- and don't wait:
                                ~ " >/dev/null </dev/null  2>&1 &")
                end menu
        end extend

    Example 2: Add to messages a menu option "FollowUp-To" which sets up
    a reply to the sender of the current message, excerpts the body of
    the message into the reply, and warps the mouse to the sendmessage
    window.  This code was the subject of a "call ness-load" in
    ~/.messagesinit.

        extend "view:messwind"
                on menu "This Message,Followup-To"
                        messages_reply_to_sender(currentwindow)
                        messages_sendmessage_compound(currentwindow,
                                "sendmessage-excerpt-body;"
                                ~ "sendmessage-focus-on-body")
                        frame_next_window(currentwindow)
                        textview_end_of_text(currentinputfocus)
                end menu
        end extend

How can I create the C code for a new inset?
    	help createinset
    This program creates a directory and puts seven files in it which
    constitute a working, though not useful, inset.  You need only
    modify the appropriate portions to make an inset which does what you
    want.
