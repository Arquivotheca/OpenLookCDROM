	      NEOS - Networked Educational On-line System

NEOS is a kerberos-authenticated service to facilitate turning in, collecting, and returning academic assignments, as well as class handouts and student-student exchange.

A one-line command sets up a course with one or more maintainers/graders.  Maintainers of a course can then act autonomously to change the access control if such need arises.

By default, student-level access ("turnin" access) includes all kerberos principals in the local realm, but this can be restricted to list of specific principals or extended to include other realms.  The grader and maintainer ACL's are equally flexible.

All the code is very portable, so compilation should be painless, especially if you use imake and already have the kerberos, hesiod and com_err libraries installed on your system (these are all available via ftp from athena-dist.mit.edu).

NEOS was written in 1989 as a project led by Professor Edward C. Barrett of the MIT Writing Program.  Under the management of Bill Cattey of MIT Project Athena, students Rob French (MIT) wrote the server, Bruce Lewis (MIT) wrote the client library and command-line clients, and Nick Williams (Imperial College, London) wrote the X-window clients available in the andrew-neos distribution.
