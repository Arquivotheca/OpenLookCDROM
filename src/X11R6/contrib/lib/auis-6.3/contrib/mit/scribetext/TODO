Teach the whole parse tree about null parameter lists.
(so that @newpage will parse to be the same as @newpage())

Clean up the use of the return values of STFunctions.
Add appropriate return values to all the functions.

Make the frequently occuring block:

  instruction = (char *) calloc (TMP_SIZE, sizeof(char));

  while((in = fgetc(fin)) != EOF)
    {
      ch = (char) in;
      if(ch == tofind)
	{
	  ch = (char) fgetc(fin);
 	  if(ch != '\n' && ch != '\r')
	    ungetc(ch, fin);
	  else
	    CurrLine++;
	  break;
	}
      sprintf(instruction, "%s%c", instruction, ch);
    }

into a subroutine;  and use strcat in place of sprintf to be
more efficient.

Modify it to handle the case of tofind being a special flag
perhaps EOF, or \n to deal with the case of a null parameter.

Make each command that is not understood to surrount it with a
\formatnote{}\n style 

Teach the error outputs to output a linenumber instead of a
number.

Modify currently uses "stupidstrip" so that when it encounters
an '@' it will not take any action.

The define command is currently mapped to delete.

The value command seems not to be finished.

The accent character stuff is now ready to be hooked in.
This includes greek.
