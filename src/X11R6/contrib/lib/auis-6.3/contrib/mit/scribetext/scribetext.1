.SH "NAME"
scribetext - convert a Scribe manuscript file to ATK file format
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
scribetext [infile [outfile]] [-t translation_table] [-e stderr_redirection]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This program converts a Scribe manuscript file to a file compatible with the
Andrew Toolkit (ATK) file format.
Scribetext requires that you specify a file for input, \fIinfile\fR.  If you 
don't specify \fIoutfile\fR, Scribetext will default to \fIinfile\fR.scribe, 
stripping off a final ".mss" from \fIinfile\fR, if appropriate.  The -t option 
allows you to specify a non-standard translation table (see 
\fIscribetrans(1)\fR).  The -e option allows you to redirect output from stderr.
Only error messages inhibiting the normal operation of the program are 
output to stderr.
.SH "SUPPORTED SCRIBE ENVIRONMENTS AND COMMANDS"
The following Scribe environments are fully supported by scribetext:  \fB@+\fR, \fB@plus\fR, \fB@-\fR, \fB
@minus\fR, \fB@b\fR, \fB@bold\fR, \fB@c\fR, \fB@center\fR, \fB@chapter\fR, \fB@display\fR, \fB@example\fR, \fB@heading\fR, \fB@i\fR, \fB@italic\fR, \fB
@majorheading\fR, \fB@p\fR, \fB@programexample\fR, \fB@quotation\fR, \fB@r\fR, \fB@section\fR, \fB@subsection\fR, \fB@subheading\fR, 
and \fB@t\fR.  
.OH
.sp 1
The following environments are partially supported:
'in 72p
'ft B
.br
.OH
.sp
@description\fR:  header words are not distinguished from regular text.\fB
.br
@enumerate\fR:  due to present ATK limitations, the numbering of paragraphs is unsupported.\fB
.br
@itemize\fR:  similarly, due to present ATK limitations, flagging with a special character 
is unsupported.\fB
.br
@u\fR, \fB@un\fR, \fB@ux\fR: due to only one ATK style of underlining (totally equivalent to \fB@ux\fR), 
all three of these environments are treated by ATK clients as though they were originally \fB
@ux\fR.
'in 36p
.br
.OH
.sp
The following commands are fully supported:  \fB@comment\fR, \fB@device\fR, \fB@foot\fR, \fB
@include\fR, and \fB@index\fR.
.OH
.sp
The following commands are partially supported:
'in 72p
'ft B
.br
.OH
.sp
@begin\fR, \fB@end\fR:  for all but the advanced Scribe user, these commands are fully supported.  
Scribetext is unable to properly handle \fB@begin(\fIenvironment\fB, \fIattribute-value list\fB)\fR, 
only the more common \fB@begin(\fIenvironment\fB)\fR.\fB
.br
@define\fR:  the only level of support offered this function is the ability to recognize 
what is being defined and to delete all future occurrences of it.
.SH "SCRIBE PUNCTUATION-CHARACTER COMMANDS"
The punctuation-character commands \fB@@\fR, \fB@~\fR, \fB@*\fR, and \fB@;\fR are fully supported.  \fB@\f(BI<space>\fR 
is fully supported to the extent that the distinction between a space which is a word 
separator and a space which is an "actual part of a semantic unit" is not made in the 
ATK file format, and therefore not in scribetext.  Similarly, \fB@.\fR is fully supported 
to the extent that the distinction between a period which represents the end of a sentence 
and a period which does not, is not made in the ATK file format.
.SH "ACCENTS IN SCRIBE AND SCRIBETEXT"
In Scribe, accents are available only in Times-Roman or 
in Helvetica with a supplementary font definition file (additional details 
available from any MIT User Consultant):  scribetext does not check to see whether 
the proper typeface is active.  It merely generates the appropriate codes in the output 
file and hopes that all future ATK client programs will know what to do with them.
.br
.OH
.sp
Accents are generated in Scribe with \fB@\f(BIfoo\fB()\fR and \fB@u\f(BIfoo\fB()\fR, where \fIfoo\fR is the identifier 
for the accent, the latter generating an uppercase accented character.  The entire 
set of accents is supported in scribetext, to the extent that it generates an ATK character 
sequence, but at present, neither ATK nor ez due to onscreen font generation capabilities 
is capable of successfully processing them.

.SH "WARNINGS"
The default location for \fIscribe.trans\fR, the translation table file, is in $ANDREWDIR/lib.  
If the environment variable ANDREWDIR is not set, scribetext will not know where to 
find the translation table file and will prompt you for its location: scribetext cannot 
function without it.
