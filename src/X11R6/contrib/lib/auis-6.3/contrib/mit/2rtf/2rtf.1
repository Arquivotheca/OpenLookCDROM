.SH "NAME"
2rtf - convert an ATK datastream file to an RTF file capable of
being used by Microsoft Word
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
2rtf [infile [outfile]] [-t translation_table] [-e stderr_redirection]
.SH "USAGE"
2rtf requires that you specify a file for input, \fIinfile\fR. 
If you don't specify \fIoutfile\fR, 2rtf will default
to \fIinfile\fR.rtf, stripping off a final ".ez" from
\fIinfile\fR, if appropriate.
.PP
The -t option allows you to specify a non-standard
translation table (see \fIrtftrans(1)\fR).
.PP
The -e option allows you to redirect output from stderr.
Only error messages inhibiting the normal operation of the
program are output to stderr.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This program, together with the rtf2 program is designed to
make it possible to edit Microsoft Word documents in EZ, and EZ
documents in Microsoft Word.Because the two editors don't
support exactly the same formatting, you have to observe the
following rules to prevent formatting information from being
lost as your document cycles between Microsoft Word and EZ.
.PP
\(bu Keep hidden text that begins: "STYLE" and "STYLESHEET"
intact.  These text regions are necessary for the reconversion
to be successful.  
.PP
\(bu Use this subset of the availableMicrosoft Word formats:
\fBFootnote...\fR, \fBFooter...\fR, Left and Right Margins
from the \fBDocument...\fR menu, Changes in the Left and Right
Indentations using the Ruler - not First line indentation,
\fBIndex Entry\fR - normal entries, Tab Changes from the
\fBParagraph...\fR menu - regular tabs, right justified and
centered tabs, \fBBold\fR, \fBItalic\fR, \fBPlain\fR, Small
caps and caps from the \fBCharacter...\fR menu, Changes in
font, Changes in font size, \fBUnderline\fR only normal
underlining, Superscript and Subscript from the
\fBCharacter...\fR menu, \fBchdate\fR, \fBchtime\fR, and
\fBchpgn\fR for headers and footers, \fBPage Break\fR, and
tabs.
.PP
These formats will partially work:
.sp 1
\fBHeader...\fR headers in ez are not placed on the first page.
Headers and Footers that are different on left and right pages,
act like regular headers and footers in ez.
.br
\fBIndex Entry\fR using bold and italic come across as normal
index entries.
.br
\fBHidden Text\fR is supported only for annotations.
.br
Special \fBUnderline\fR commands are ignored, and come across
as normal underlining.
.br
\fBnil\fR, \fBroman\fR, \fBswiss\fR, \fBmodern\fR,
\fBscript\fR, \fBdecor\fR, and \fBtech\fR these font families
are supported in that each family maps to one font  in that
family.
.PP
\(bu Use the styles that were converted from the EZ document.
They appear in the ruler...... 
.sp 1
- Styles involving constant margin or indentation changes.
.br
- Styles involving the above or below spacing.
.br
- Styles involving the interline spacing.
.br
- Styles changing to font family.
.br
- Styles involving a constant font size change.
.br
- Styles involving a constant script movement.
.br
- Styles involving a tab change.
.br
- Styles involving changing the font face, i.e. bold, italic,
plain.
.br
- Styles involving changing the justification of text.
.PP
\(bu Avoid the following EZ styles:  (Although they will
convert to to RTF, Microsoft Word will not let you apply them
to new text.) 
.sp 1
- Any style involving relative margin or indentation changes.
.br
- Any style involving a relative change in the font size.
.br
- Any style involving relative script movement.

RTF is a registered trademark of Microsoft Inc.
.SH "BUGS"
RTF format enforces a stupid convention that styles begin on a
paragraph boundry.  Depending on where EZ styles begin and
end, this enforcement can inject blank lines into text where
you do not want them.
