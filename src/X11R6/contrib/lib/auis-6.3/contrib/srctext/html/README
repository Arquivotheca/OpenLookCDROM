HTMLTEXT Version 1.2
-----------------------

This is an editing object for HTML text.
It is based on the standard ATK text object.
It is available from ftp.cs.city.ac.uk:/pub/htmltext/
For more details, see http://web.cs.city.ac.uk/homes/njw/htmltext/htmltext.html
and see the paper http://web.cs.city.ac.uk/homes/njw/htmltext/www94.html

Instructions on installing if you have ATK already:
1) Compile it up:
	genmake
	make Install

2) Modify your .ezinit or your .atkinit or your global.ezinit, etc....
   to have the following:
	include $(ANDREWDIR)/lib/html.init
   where ANDREWDIR is the location of your installed andrew tree.

3) edit a file with the .html extension!

See the htmlview.help file for more comments.  I'll slowly patch up this help file to have more helpful comments, honest!

Send comments to njw@cs.city.ac.uk.


Notes on this version:
* It has the point size of the fonts explicitly stated in the template file.
  This is an attempt to make the fontsize similar to the size used in 
  NCSA Mosaic.

* Many features would be nice (for example, following a link, loading in
  a file via http, seeing the document title in a nice label widget, etc) but
  aren't there.  This is because this is purely an HTML text widget.  A real
  HTML editor would contain an htmltext object and be wrapped up with other
  things to do the features. e.g. http retrieval should be placed into 
  an http version of the frame object. I have attempted to use ADEW to 
  develop a more complete editor, but I can't quite grok ADEW yet. I believe
  Tom Neuendorffer is working on something in this line...

* Known drawbacks/bugs:

  - the title of a document isn't visible enough, and the variables associated
    with the <head> are not editable in a nice or consistent way compared with
    the rest of the system.  I'll be fixing this when I work out some nicer
    way of placing the htmltext into a real editor frame (using ADEW).

  - the menus aren't particularly user-friendly.  If some comments on HCIness
    of the system come back to me, I'll try fixing this up.

  - description lists are not enabled.
