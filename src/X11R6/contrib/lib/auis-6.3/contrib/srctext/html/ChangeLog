	* html.c: added in a few minor fixes from ATK consortium: now sets
	all styles to normal after the document has been loaded in;
	Removed unnecessary calls to load in the template; slightly
	modified the way styles are placed during closeEntity.  This
	should hopefully fix a few bugs seen around the place.  Made all
	local routines static to avoid name clashes from other dynamically
	loaded objects.

	* html.c: drafted out support for ChangeAttribute callbacks. This
	allows the image to notice if the source has changed, etc.

	* html.c: fixed bug pointed out by Tom Neuendorffer; nextid was
	not declared as a singleton tag.

	* htmlview.c: Made the EditAttributes dialog box more complex: now
	you can switch between different environments using it, making M-s
	unnecessary (especially as many people didn't know how to select
	different nested styles).

	* html.c: Fixed up the list insertion to correctly handle
	sublists.  Now when a list is applied to a highlit region, it will
	always apply a new list environment to the region.

	* html.tpl: (also html.init) slight reorganization of the menus.

	* Updated the help file and README.  Now has some useful things to
	say in the help file!

	* Removed all of the explicit marker routines from htmlview and
	the binding in html.c.  Now you're stuck with plain old newlines
	(phew!).

	* html.c: Re-did the newline/parbreak stuff AGAIN.  Removed the
	explicit markers. Fixed up all of the things related to this. Now
	it's much better. Trust me.  Also, the output is much more
	readable with this code.

	* html.c: Changed the environment variables below to be profiles.
	Now *.defaultImage is used for the unknown image, and *.webPath is
	used to determine the path for finding images.

	* html.c: Added capability for displaying inline images.  Can only
	display images which can be found in the local filesystem, either
	specified relative to current document or by looking through a
	path of "root directories".  E.g. for us, /vol/web/root is the top
	of all WWW documents, so setting WWW_PATH to this will allow any
	absolute images to be found through this.  Uses value of
	WWW_UNKNOWN_IMAGE as the image to view when no file can be found.
	Note: all images MUST currently be GIF.

	* html.c: Fixed bug in WriteSubString which caused core dumps when
	writing text which contains imbedded views: it was always calling
	closeEntity even when not looking at a style.

Sat Apr 30 18:49:45 1994  Nick Williams  (njw@wilma.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* added correct(?) copyright messages and disclaimers into all
	source files.

	* version.c: created a package version number.  Called it 1.0, for
	lack of any other good number!

	* html.c: Added an HTML-Errors buffer: if any errors are found
	during read of an HTML stream, the errors are placed into this
	buffer.  Unfortunately, the object doesn't yet pop this buffer up...

Fri Apr 29 10:34:19 1994  Nick Williams  (njw@wilma.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* htmlview.c: fixed up the return value of the Hit method and
	optimised it a bit, both based on comments from Tom Neuendorffer.

	* html.c: added fixes from Tom Neuendorffer:
	made sure all string functions return static strings rather than
	random stack data.

Thu Apr 21 08:05:34 1994  Nick Williams  (njw@wilma.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* html.c: Added patch from Todd Inglett to fix the
	StylesIncludeEnd bug: whenever a style is placed into the
	document, the environment returned is marked as StyleInclude
	neither end nor beginning.

Wed Mar 30 15:41:10 1994  Nick Williams  (njw@wilma.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* html.c: Modified the style placement code, to ensure that they
	get wrapped the correct way around.  This caused a bug where
	images were outside the anchors. Blech.  The fix isn't too nice,
	either. Don't look.

Thu Feb 24 10:09:13 1994  Nick Williams  (njw@wilma.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* html.c: Added in explicit paragraph markers and line breaks.
	Vastly improved the HTML code that gets written out.

Thu Jan 20 11:53:22 1994  Nick Williams  (njw@wilma.cs.city.ac.uk)

	* html.c: Added in some HTML+ entities, so it won't junk things
	arbitrarily.
