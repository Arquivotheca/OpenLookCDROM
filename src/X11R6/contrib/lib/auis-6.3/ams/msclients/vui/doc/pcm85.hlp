Specify a folder to receive copies of outgoing mail.

If you specify that you want copies kept of outgoing mail,
the copies are sent to your mailbox and appear as mail messages that are
addressed to you.  If you use the folder option, which sets *.bccto: in your
preferences file, VUI will automatically send a blind copy of all outgoing
mail to the folder you specify.
