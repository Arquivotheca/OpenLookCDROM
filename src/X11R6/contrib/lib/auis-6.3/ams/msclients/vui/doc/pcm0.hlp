Choose a group of messages for reading.

Read shows all captions of messages in the folder since the date stored in
your profile for that folder, plus one old one.  If you want to see messages
older than these you can press PageUp/Esc-v to scroll back.  Or you can
choose the Change option to specify what message number to start at.
