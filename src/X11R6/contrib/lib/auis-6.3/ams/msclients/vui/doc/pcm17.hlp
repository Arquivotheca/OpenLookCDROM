Subscribe by printing new messages

A Print subscription fully subscribes you to a folder, but prints all of your
new messages instead of displaying them.  New messages are printed on your
remote Vice printer each time you process your subscribed folders with
Feature 4.  A print subscription can be useful for low-volume bulletin boards
or bulletin boards which contain digests of information.
