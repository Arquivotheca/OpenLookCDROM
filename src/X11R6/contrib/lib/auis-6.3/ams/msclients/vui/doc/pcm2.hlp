Delete the highlighted folder

Before deletion takes place, one of two confirmation messages appears:

	Are you sure you want to delete the folder ______ ?

	There are ___ messages in this folder--Delete them ?

In either case, type Y to delete the folder and N to prevent deletion of the
folder.  If you delete a folder, you cannot get it back, so be sure to delete
with caution.
