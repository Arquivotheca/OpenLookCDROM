Another unusual feature of the AMS is \bold{voting}.  Special messages can 
call for a vote of the readership of a bboard.  Votes are sent automatically 
to a designated mail address.  At present, voting is not anonymous -- quite 
the reverse, in fact; it is heavily authenticated, to detect people voting 
more than once.


The recipient of the vote responses has several tools at his disposal to make 
the tabulation of votes easier.  The AMS incorporates an extension language 
that can be used to specify where new incoming messages are placed; thus one 
can easily arrange for incoming votes to go to a special folder separate from 
other incoming mail.  Then, the "message marking" feature of messages, and 
particularly the "Find All Captions" operation, can be used to tabulate votes 
relatively quickly and painlessly.  (This is a good time to demonstrate the 
message marking features.)
