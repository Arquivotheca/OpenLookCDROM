Another unusual feature supported by the AMS is Return-receipt mail.   This 
feature allows users to request automatic acknowledgements when their mail is 
first read by the recipient, and makes it easy fo the recipients to provide 
such acknowledgements.


\smaller{\italic{Please note}:  In demonstrating the system, you will only be 
asked to send an acknowledgement by this message if 1) you have write-access 
to the demo folder and 2) you have not said "yes" to sending an 
acknowledgement previously.  If you don't have write-access or you have 
already sent an acknowledgement, this message will not ask you if you want to 
send one.  If you have write-access and have already sent an acknowledgement 
and want the demo to start working again, you should use CUI to "reconstruct" 
the demo folder.
