This message folder is a demonstration of the key features and structure of 
the Andrew Message System.  It is intended for use in demonstrating the system 
to new and propspective users.


In general, you can follow the demo by repeatedly using the space key (or the 
"Show More" menu, if you don't use keyboard commands.)  Occasionally, the text 
will suggest that you do something else to demonstrate certain features.


Credits and acknowledgements for the Andrew Message System will be found at 
the end of this demonstration folder.
