The Andrew Message System incorporates several unusual features not found in 
most other message systems.  For example, each message can have one or more 
special attributes, which tell the AMS program libraries that special action 
should be taken based on the contents of the message.  Some messages, such as 
this one, are used to announce the creation of a new folder, or bulletin 
board, and to ask users if they want to subscribe.  On tree structured 
bulletin boards, the creation of a new bulletin board \italic{always} causes a 
notice such as this one to appear on the parent bboard; thus if you subscribe 
to "andrew.interface" and someone creates "andrew.interface.macintosh", you 
will see a message on "andrew.interface" asking if you want to subscribe to 
the new bulletin board.  


Because this feature is handled by the library, it is easily supported by all 
of the client interfaces.


\smaller{(\bold{If this message does not work }(i.e. it does not ask you to 
subscribe to something), you probably need to change the headers to refer to a 
real bboard or mail folder that exists at your site and that you are 
\italic{not} subscribed to.)
