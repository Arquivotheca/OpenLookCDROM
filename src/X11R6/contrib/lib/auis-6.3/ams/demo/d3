\typewriter{In the beginning, electronic mail looked like this.  

It all appeared in a single fixed-width font, was 

monotonous to look at, and strained the eyes.


Actually, as you probably know, it looked a lot worse 

than this, but it is amazingly hard to get a modern 

workstation screen to look as bad as a standard CRT.  

But if you take what you're looking at now, and 

picture it on a tiny green screen with a painful 

flicker, you've got the right picture in mind.


Perhaps the most ***PATHETIC*** aspect of this technology

was the way people tried to use it to convey emotions.

For example, people would --> E M P H A S I Z E < --

words or indicate humor with funny symbols :-)

all of which served, in the end, only to make the text

more ****UGLY**** than it was in the first place.
