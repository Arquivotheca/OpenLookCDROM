.TH MUSERVER 8 "October 30, 1991"
.SH NAME
muserver \- master update server process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /usr/local/etc/muserver
.SH DESCRIPTION
This server forks to become a "update" process and a "server" process.
The update process watches the master update files as specified by
\fI/etc/AndrewSetup\fR, and sends them to the server process.
The server process receives periodic updates from the update process
and services requests on the server port (currently 6666).

Master update server requests are a single line with a bboard name
(short form) followed by a newline.  The server will respond with a
the bboard name, and if the lookup is successful, a directory
specification and the 6 character timestamp for the message followed
by a newline.  The directory specification is " A" for
\fIOfficialBboardRoot\fR, " B" for \fILocalBboardRoot\fR, " C" for
\fIExternalBboardRoot\fR, and " /<path> " for other bboards.

A line beginning with "$q" indicates the client is finished with
requests.

For best results, all the requests should be sent, then all the
responses read to minimize waiting for the connection round trip.

The server requires no special privileges, and may be run as any user.
.SH "STATUS"
Log files are written by both the update and server process to help
track problems.  See the FILES section below for filenames.  The
logs are only written when an error occurs.

To get status information from the server, do "telnet <host> 6666".
Once connected, type "$i\\n" to get status information as follows:
.nf
$i
lastupdate: Wed Oct 30 11:25:47 1991
num updates: 1
conns active: 1
conns done: 8
last time: 0.039060
avg time: 0.056637
avg requests: 113
max active: 2
$i
.fi

Once this command has been sent, the current connection will not be
included in the statistics.  The $q command may be used to cleanly
terminate the connection.

To reset the statistics, send a SIGHUP to the server process (the one
with the highest pid).  This will reset the "conns done", the "avg time",
and the "avg requests" fields.

To stop the server, kill the update process (the one with the lowest
pid).  The server process will immediately notice, write statistics to
the log file, and exit.
