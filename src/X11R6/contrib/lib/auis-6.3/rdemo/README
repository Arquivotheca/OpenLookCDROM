This directory tree contains the sources for the Remote Andrew Demo
(rdemo for short).  Rdemo is an Internet network service provided by a
few nodes at the Andrew Toolkit Consortium.  It allows users anywhere
on the Internet to interactively experiment with Andrew software.

We do not expect that people will want to build rdemo and provide the
network service themselves.  We've included the sources because we
expect that some people may wish to emulate this revolutionary service
and create their own remote demos.  The sources are included
primarily for the edification of programmers who wish to do this
(although there's nothing stopping you from building the rdemo suite
if you so desire).

Note that these sources, in a slightly different form, were built (and
in fact used) on an IBM RT running 4.3 BSD Unix, AFS, and configured
for Andrew software.  The sources have never been built or tested on
any other platform, and in particular the sources as they appear here
haven't ever been built.  A future version will likely have a better
version of this tree.

The file Design.d, in this directory, describes the workings of the
Remote Andrew Demo and the history of its design:  the security
issues, the load issues, and so on.

The Imakefile/Makefile scheme used in this directory is an unholy
combination of the usual Andrew build conventions and certain special
hacks required by the architecture of this tree.  If you attempt to
build this tree, first look in config.csh and change the variables
appropriately.  Next, run "genmake" in this directory as you normally
would elsewhere.  This creates the top Makefile.  The command "make
Makefiles" re-makes the top Makefile and exits.  You'll have to re-run
"make Makefiles" at that point.  This will happen several times in the
build process (sorry).  Whenever you see the message

	*** Makefile has been recomputed.  Re-run make command.

you should re-issue exactly the last make command.  Don't worry, this
message is normal, and even though the build keeps stopping, you're
actually making progress.
