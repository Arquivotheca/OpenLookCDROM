This directory holds papers written about the Andrew Toolkit.  Papers in this directory are in ATK format and can be read using Andrew's multi-media editor ez.  Postscript versions of these papers exist in the top-level cdrom directory doc.  

These papers are also available for anonymous FTP on emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu in directory ./papers;  the file name there is given in curly braces at the end of the citation.  An asterisk at the end of the entry means that subsidiary files are under the same name with suggestive extensions:  figs - figures;  appendix - appendix;  tar - subfiles must be extracted with 'tar xvf';  Z - the file must be 'uncompress'ed or 'zcat'ed.
