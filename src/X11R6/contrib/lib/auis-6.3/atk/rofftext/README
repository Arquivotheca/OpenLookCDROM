Rofftext enhancement
Author: Charles Hayden cch@mtgzx.att.com  4/20/90

Extensively modified to support additional troff macros.
Also included is an extensively-modified mm macro package that eliminates a lot of the
garbage that mm goes through for no useful purpose, and which just generates extraneous stuff anyway.

This package handles footnotes and references by turning them into Andrew footnotes; tables by turning them into spreadsheets; and tags and PIC by turning them into links.   It has an experimental hypertext button macro, .BU.
Headings (using the .H macro) are marked so that they show up in the Table of Contents.
Several bugs in original rofftext are fixed, but otherwise it is upwardly compatible.
