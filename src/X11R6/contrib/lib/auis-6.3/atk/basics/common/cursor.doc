The cursor package provides methods by which views may specify the look of the 
mouse position indicator as it passes over sections of the screen.

\section{Overview of cursor}\indexi{Cursor}


There are three basic types of cursors:  \italic{window cursors}, which are 
cursors that are assigned to an entire window, \italic{view cursors}, which 
are assigned to views and sub-rectangles thereof , and \italic{process 
cursors}, which are displayed in all windows associated with a process.  A 
mouse cursor that is constant in an entire window would be a window cursor, 
and cursors that change shape depending on its position in the window would be 
view cursor. Cursors not associated with a particular view may \italic{only} 
be used as window or process cursors; a view cursor is bound to its view. 
Process cursors override all other cursors. Window cursors override view 
cursors. 

\indexi{Cursor++Types of} 


Only one window cursor and one process cursor is allowed per window.  Views 
that use either of these kinds of cursors should make sure to retract them 
when their input focus is lost.  Parent views should call 
\italic{view_RetractViewCursors} on their children before calling their 
child's \italic{FullUpdate} routine, but view cursors are automatically 
retracted (but not destroyed) during a \italic{FullUpdate}.  It is up to the 
view's FullUpdate method to repost view cursors if necessary.  If a cursor is 
destroyed, however, then it is automatically retracted, and a call to a 
retract method is not necessary.  When cursors are created, they are posted up 
to the interaction manager which keeps a list of the cursors. 

\indexi{Cursor++Posting} 

\indexi{Cursor++Retracting} 


Process cursors are set by the interaction manager with a call to 
\italic{im_SetProcessCursor}, window cursors are posted by a call to 
\italic{im_SetWindowCursor}, and view cursors are posted with a call to 
\italic{view_PostCursor}.  Cursor posts are time dependent, and the last post 
made will always have precedence over previous posts.  However, reposting an 
already posted cursor will not affect it's precedence. To give a reposted 
cursor priority over other cursors, you  first call \italic{view_RetractCursor} 
 to take the cursor out completely, then repost it.  


If a posted cursor requests a rectangle that completely obscures a previously 
posted cursor, the previous cursor is \italic{not} automatically retracted. 
 Thus, a post followed by a retraction will leave the cursors in the same 
original state.  Posts and retractions filter up the tree, so it is possible 
for parents to filter their children's posts.  Cursor posts made when the 
window or process cursor is already set are noted but not activated until the 
window or process cursor is reset.

\subsection{Creating cursors}


\paragraph{Creating an instance of a cursor} \indexi{ \italic{cursor_Create}}

\indexi{Cursor++Creating} 

\example{cursor_Create (view)

struct view *view;} 


\leftindent{\bold{Class procedure description.} \italic{cursor_Create} creates 
a new cursor associated with \italic{view}. 


\bold{Return value.}  Returns a pointer to the newly created instance of the 
cursor; \smaller{NULL} on failure. 


\bold{Usage.}  You would call this procedure to create the cursor, and use the 
methods below to set its shape, then use one of \italic{im_SetProcessCursor}, 
\italic{im_SetWindowCursor}, or \italic{view_PostCursor} to post it.

\subsection{Setting the shape of a cursor}


\paragraph{Setting a cursor shape to a known standard} 
\indexi{ \italic{cursor_SetStandard}}

\indexi{Cursor++Standard shapes} 

\example{cursor_SetStandard (cursor, CursorShape)

struct cursor *cursor;

short CursorShape;} 


\leftindent{\bold{Method description.  }\italic{cursor_SetStandard}  sets the 
shape of the cursor to one of the standard cursors recognized by the 
underlying window system. This is the preferred method to use for writing 
portable applications. 


\bold{Usage.}     The following cursors are currently supported under 
\italic{wm}

and X window managers. 


\leftindent{
Cursor_Arrow

Cursor_Gunsight 

Cursor_Cross 

Cursor_Wait 

Cursor_HorizontalBars  

Cursor_LowerRightCorner 

Cursor_UpperLeftCorner 

Cursor_VerticalBars 

Cursor_DangerousBend 

Cursor_Caret 

Cursor_VerticalArrows 

Cursor_HorizontalArrows 

Cursor_Octagon 

Cursor_LeftPointer

Cursor_RightPointer

Cursor_CrossHairs

Cursor_DownPointer

Cursor_UpPointer

Cursor_Cutter

Cursor_LargeUpArrow

Cursor_LargeDownArrow

Cursor_EnclosedDot

Cursor_SmallCross

Cursor_SmallLeftPointer

Cursor_SmallRightPointer

}
If you are calling this method to change the shape of an already posted 
cursor, it is not necessary to repost the cursor.  Note that these names do 
not conform to the conventions of the rest of the Andrew Toolkit:  the 'c' in 
'Cursor_' is capitalized. 


\bold{Example.}   The following creates an arrow shaped cursor. 

\example{
struct view *self;

struct cursor *cp;

cp = cursor_Create(self);

cursor_SetStandard(cp,Cursor_Arrow);

}
}

\paragraph{Setting the cursor shape to a font character} 
\indexi{ \italic{cursor_SetGlyph}}

\indexi{Cursor++Shape} 

\example{cursor_SetGlyph (cursor, font, char)

struct cursor *cursor;

struct fontdesc *font;

short char;

}
\leftindent{\bold{Method description.  }\italic{cursor_SetGlyph}  sets the 
shape of the cursor to a font character.  The origin information of the 
character is used to determine the cursor's 'hot spot.'


\bold{Usage.}     Again, if you are changing an already posted cursor, you do 
not need to repost.

 

\bold{Example.}  The following creates a c shaped cursor. 

\example{
struct view *self;

struct cursor *cp;

static struct fontdesc *fd;

fd = fontdesc_Create("andy",0,12);

cp = cursor_Create(self);

cursor_SetGlyph(cp,fd,'C');

}
}
