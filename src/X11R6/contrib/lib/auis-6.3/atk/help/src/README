History:

	- original be2 version of help by: Mike Kazar, c. 1985

	- complete atk rewrite by: Marc Pawliger, 1/88 - 3/88

Debugging info:
	- compile all modules with -DDEBUGGING
	- setenv HELPDEBUG HELPAPPDEBUG HELPDBDEBUG to turn on
	  debugging for the different modules
Files:

config.h:
	- #defines for site-specific information, directory locations, and
	  other configuration constants

helpsys.h:
	- defines all the structures and constants used
	  throughout the Help system

helpa.c and helpa.ch:
	- An application subclass
	- front end to help
	- parses all arguments
	- talks to existing helps through a socket or can bring up another
	  instance of help
	- creates an im and a frame and inserts a help object into the frame

help.c and help.ch:
	- A view subclass object with no associated dataobject
	- main workhorse
	- can have either an lpair or scrollbar as a top-level view linked
	  to it's frame
	- can create helpviews as "children".

  help.h:
	  - error messages and key and menu bindings for the help object

helpdb.c and helpdb.ch:
	- A package of routines that contains directory search code and libindex calls.
	  Done this way so that multiple help object instances only load
	  this code once.

helpmac.an:
	- troff macros to make man pages appear better under Help



NOTE:	As is, help will only read in files that use textview or a subclass of
	it as their view.  A furture change might be to create a new view,
	and install GetApplicationLayer(newview) as the view on the help file.
	Note that in this case all text-search mechanisms should be disabled.
