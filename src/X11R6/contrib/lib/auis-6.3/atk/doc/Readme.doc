\chapter{ATK Documentation Library}



ATK documentation includes general documents, user help files, modules 
describing each class, tutorial modules discussing example programs.  The 
locations of these files in the installed system is described in the following 
paragraphs, where it is assumed that $ANDREWDIR is the root of the tree into 
which Andrew is installed (your site administrator and other Andrew users will 
know where this is).  A final section gives the file locations in the source.


Users may wish to begin with 

	ez $ANDREWDIR/doc/intro.d

The principal document reading tool for users is the 'help' program;  running 
it without an argument brings it up displaying a general overview, while 
running it with a specific argument starts it with help on that topic.  Help 
can view standard Unix 'man' documents as well as ATK documents.  The help 
files are installed in $ANDREWDIR/help/.


ATK programmers should read overview.doc and progenv.doc files for general 
information on working with ATK.  These files are installed in 
$ANDREWDIR/doc/atk/.   The example programs and discussions in 
$ANDREWDIR/doc/atk/examples will also be useful.  Modules describing each 
object class are in $ANDREWDIR/doc/atk/\italic{group}/, where group is named 
in accordance with the location of the source code.  For instance, view.doc is 
in $ANDREWDIR/doc/atk/basics/.  


In the source code, help and doc files are stored along with the source code 
for the particular object class.  Since view.c is in 
$ANDREWSRC/atk/basics/common, that is also the location of view.doc.  Since 
eza.c, the application for ez, is in $ANDREWSRC/atk/ez/, the various 
ez\italic{xxxx}.help files are there as well.


A hardcopy version of the library set (which includes figures for the overview 
and examples) is available from the Information Technology Center.  Refer 
orders to the distribution center care of:
