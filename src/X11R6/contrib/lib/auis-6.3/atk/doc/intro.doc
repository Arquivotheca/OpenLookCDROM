Introduction to the

Andrew  User Interface System}}



The Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is an integrated set of tools that 
allow you to create, use, and mail documents and applications containing 
typographically formatted text and embedded objects.  AUIS has three 
principal components:


\indent{The Andrew User Environment (AUE) is an integrated set of 
applications beginning with a 'generic object' editor (ez), a help system, 
a system monitoring tool (console), an editor-based shell interface 
(typescript), and support for printing multi-media documents. \



The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable user-interface toolkit.  It provides 
a dynamically-loadable, object-oriented environment wherein objects can be 
embedded in one-another. Thus, one could edit text that contains not only 
fonts and styles, but also embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing 
editors, equations, simple animations, etc. These embedded objects could 
themselves contain other objects, including text. ATK is an open system so 
programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as easily as those 
system-defined objects. \



The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface to mail 
and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail management strategies and 
implements many advanced  features including authentication, return 
receipts, automatic sorting of mail, vote collection and tabulation, 
enclosures, audit trails of related messages, and subscription management. 
It also provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and low-function 
personal computers in addition to the high-function workstations. }\



\{History: In 1982 Carnegie Mellon and IBM entered into a joint venture and 
formed the Information Technology Center to design a very powerful, 
advanced function workstation and distributed computing environment on 
campus.    This environment is known as the Andrew System, named for the 
university's two major benefactors, Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon.  In 
1992, the School of Computer Science formed the Andrew Consortium to 
extend, support and distribute the Andrew User Interface System  (AUIS). 
 Although the term "Andrew"  is used for many different parts of the campus 
computing system environment, this present paper is restricted to AUIS.\}



\heading{______________________________________________________

Running AUIS}


To run AUIS, you must have access to a UNIX\smaller{\superscript{(tm)}} 
workstation running the X window system and some window manager.  \



The ANDREWDIR, CLASSPATH, and PATH environment variables control your 
access to the AUIS system.  In /afs/cs.cmu.edu, the AUIS binaries are 
located in the /usr/misc/.atk tree.  To utilize AUIS for one login session, 
type these commands in a csh:

	setenv ANDREWDIR /usr/misc/.atk

	setenv CLASSPATH $ANDREWDIR/dlib/atk

	setenv PATH $ANDREWDIR/bin:$PATH \


In /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/, the AUIS software is in /usr/local so the first of 
the above lines should be:

	setenv ANDREWDIR /usr/local

In other environments, the setting of ANDREWDIR may vary;  sometimes it is 
/usr/andrew.


To have AUIS available everytime you log in, add the three lines above to 
your ~/.cshrc file.



The following sections outline the various capabilities offerd by each 
principal component of AUIS.  Extensive help files are available under 
various keywords listed below.  To see help on some keyword, invoke the AUE 
help system with a command like \



	\typewriter{\bold{% help tour}}


Once the help system is running you can ask it for help on additional 
topics: select the menu item "Show help on ...".  When the prompt appears 
in the bottom line of the window, type the topic name and press the return 
key.  Useful topics to begin with include: 
\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{menus}, \helptopic{mouse}, 
\helptopic{windows}, \helptopic{scrollbar}, \helptopic{help}, 
\helptopic{ez}, \helptopic{typescript}, \helptopic{console}, 
\helptopic{messages}}}\italic{.}  The \italic{tour} topic lists a number of 
other introductory documents.

\subsection{

Andrew Demo

}
In order to get a feel of the Andrew User Interface System, we've provided 
a demo environment that you can navigate through.  To access the 
application, type the following at the command prompt: \



\bold{\typewriter{	\bold{\typewriter{% }}launch}}



\heading{______________________________________________________

User interface

}
The scroll bar is the column on the left of your windows.  When a document 
is too long to show its entire contents in a window, you can use the scroll 
bar to bring different parts of the document into view.  The scroll bar 
consists of 4 parts:


\leftindent{1.  The buttons at either end of the bar.  A left click on one 
of these moves the display immediately to the beginning or end of the 
document. A right click moves one unit in the indicated direction.

2.  The bar itself--the long outer rectangle between the two end buttons. 
 The extent of the document is mapped to this bar so each point on the bar 
corresponds linearly to a point in the document.

3.  The "elevator"--a rectangle within the bar.  It indicates what portion 
of the entire document is currently displayed in the window.

4.  The "dot"--a small square or narrow rectangle within the bar.  It 
indicates what region of the document is currently selected.}

For more detailed information on scroll bars, request help on 
\bold{\typewriter{scroll}}.  \



\subheading{Menus}


Menus are cards which contain lists of actions you can take on an entire 
window, or on information inside a window.  AUIS offers two types of menus: 
 "pop-up" menus are not visible until you pop them up by pressing the 
middle mouse button;   "pull-down" menus are pulled down from headings 
already on the screen as with MacIntsoh applications.   The default menu is 
the "pop-up", which is the described in this document.  To learn more about 
"pull-down" menus,  see the  \bold{\typewriter{menubar}} help file.


There are two different pop-up methods you can use to make menus appear and 
select one of the menu options.   (On machines with only two buttons, the 
middle button is simulated by clicking or pressing both buttons.) \



\subheading{Method 1: Press and hold}


\indent{To see menus, move the mouse cursor into the body of the window. 
 Press and hold down the middle mouse button.  To vanish the menus, move 
the cursor outside of the menu and release the mouse button.


To select an option in the menus, move the cursor so that the desired 
option is darkened.  Release the mouse button.  After you've selected an 
option, the menus disappear.}


\subheading{Method 2: Clicking}


\indent{To see menus, move the mouse cursor into the body of the window. 
 Click the middle mouse button.  (If the menus do not appear, you held the 
button down too long;  try again.)  To remove menus, move the cursor 
outside of the menu and click the mouse button again.


To select an option in the menus, move the cursor so that the desired 
option is darkened.  Click the middle mouse button again.  After you've 
selected an option, the menus disappear.}


\subsection{Text Selection}


When editing text in AUE you typically select a piece of text and then 
perform some action with either a keystroke sequence or a menu selection. 
 The current text selection is either a position between two characters as 
indicated with a caret below the base line, or it is a range of text 
indicated in reverse video, that is, white-on-black instead of 
black-on-white.  You select text with the mouse.


To set the caret:  point between two characters and click the left mouse 
button.


To select a range of text:  move the mouse cursor to one oend of the range 
and press the left mouse button.  While holding it down, move to the other 
end of the range and let the button up.


To extend a range of text: move the mouse cursor to the deisred end of the 
range and click the right button.  Or press the right button and hold it 
down while moving the mouse until the desired range is highlighted;  then 
release the button.


\subsection{Message line}


The bottom edge of most AUE windows is partitioned off.  When an 
application has a message for you, it displays it often displays it here. 
 Messages may also appear in a dialog box in the middle of the window 
or--occasionally--in the \bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{console}}} window. 
 If the application needs information from you, such as a help topic or a 
file name, it prompts in the message line and characters you type are 
displayed there.  You may use almost all ATK text editing facilities to 
construct your reply in the message line.


\subsection{Preferences}


A "preference" is exactly that; you indicate your preference as to how a 
program should behave for you, where there are more than one behavior 
provided by the system designers (usually at the behest of users).  When a 
program starts up, it consults the file "preferences" in your home 
directory.  Consult the \bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{preferences}}} help 
topic.




\heading{______________________________________________________

Andrew User Environment (AUE) Components}


For each of the following components the name of the component is a help 
topic.


\subheading{\helptopic{typescript}}


\indent{Typescript is a window in which you type and enter Andrew and 
operating system commands.


Commands that you enter in Typescript get passed along to the shell, a 
program that interprets commands for the operating system.  You do not have 
to know more about the shell in order to use Typescript.  However, if you 
would \italic{like} to know more about the shell, you can look at the 
\bold{\typewriter{csh}} help document.  Typescript can be used as a front 
end to other programs in addition to the shell.   }\



\subheading{\subheading{\helptopic{ez}}}


\indent{Ez is an editing program that you can use to create, edit, and 
format many different types of documents.  The ez help document tells you 
how to use EZ to create and edit text documents.  Other formats include 
\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{raster}}}, 
\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{table}}}, animations 
(\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{fad}}}), drawings 
(\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{figure}}}), and equations 
(\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{eq}}}).  Typically, ez is started with the 
name of a file as its argument:

	ez ~/preferences

If the file is a plain ASCII file, it will be maintained that way and 
written out that way.  If styles are editted, the stored form will contain 
formatting information.  For those accustomed to editing without a mouse, 
ez accepts most of the more commonly used keysequences of Unipress Emacs 
(help \bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{ez-keys}}}).  By setting a preference 
option, you can have the gnuemacs keybindings instead (help 
\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{gnuemacs}}}).}


\subheading{\helptopic{console}}


\indent{Console keeps track of of status information about your workstation 
and files.  It can display a digital or analog clock, monitor various 
aspects of your system's performance, notify you about the arrival of mail, 
warn you about system errors, and much more.}


\subheading{\helptopic{help} }\



\leftindent{Help finds and displays information about Andrew and its 
programs as well as about the UNIX operating system.}


\subheading{\helptopic{ezprint}}

\indent{
Ezprint prepares document files (created using the  \italic{EZ } editor) 
for printing and then prints them.  Files can also be printed from a menu 
option on the File card of ez menus.}



\heading{______________________________________________________

The Andrew Toolkit (ATK)}


\subheading{\helptopic{insets}}


An inset is a software package that helps you create, edit, and display 
information in a particular format--like a text editor lets you manipulate 
text, or a spreadsheet lets you manipulate tabular information.   A 
document created with the editor  EZ  can have many different insets in it. 
 For example, you can put a  table  inset directly into a document and edit 
it in place.  You can also nest insets recursively, so you might have a 
 raster  inset (displaying a digitized picture) inside a table that is 
itself inside a text document.


Several insets are also applications, meaning that they can be run as 
programs separately, without being inside an ez document.  Most 
applications are editors of different types of information.


The following insets are both embeddable insets and standalone 
applications:\indent{


\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{raster}}} - a raster (bitmap) editor

\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{eq}}} - an equation editor

\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{fad}}} - a simple frame animator

\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{table}}} - a simple spreadsheet

\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{org}}} - an organizational chart editor

\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{bush}}} - a directory tree/file browser (built 
on org)

\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{chart}}} - a chart/graph program (line graphs, 
pie charts, histograms etc.)


}The following insets are only insets can cannot be run as applications.

\indent{
\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{text}}} - for formatted text

\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{ctext}}} - an editor for C language programs 
(not an interpreter)

\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{lookz}}} - editor for the typographical styles 
in a document

\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{ness}}} - programming language and object 
extension language


}In the above, all inset types are help topics.


With the toolkit, programmers can create new objects that can be embedded 
as easily as those that come with the system.  One way to create a new 
inset is with the \bold{\typewriter{createinset}} command.

The Andrew Message System (AMS)}


The Andrew Message System is the system by which mail and bulletin board 
messages are transmitted on Andrew.  The Andrew Message System includes 
user programs (such as \bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{messages}}} and 
\bold{\typewriter{\helptopic{sendmessage}}}) as well as underlying programs 
and subroutines (the message server, the CUI library, the SNAP remote 
procedure call package, and the guardian).  The Andrew Message System also 
provides a White Pages facility that can be used by mail-sending programs 
for matching user names to user ids so that mail can be sent to Andrew 
users by their names as well as by their user ids. \



More detailed information about the Andrew Message System can be found by 
requesting help on \bold{\typewriter{AMS}}.  \
