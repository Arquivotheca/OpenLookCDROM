\section{\{\{Future:  4. Ness Program Development Support}


The Ness system offers two levels of program development support: editing 
tools and debugging tools.


\subsection{Editing Tools}


The Ness editing tools can be associated with a Ness script or program in 
either of two ways.  If you are editing a script in a Ness inset, these 
tools are automatically in place.  If you are editing a Ness program you 
can add the following to your .atkinit file:

	

	addfiletype .n ntext


Then any file you edit with the extension ".n" will have these editing 
aids.


\italic{Automatic completion and indentation.}  As you type a newline after 
the first line of a statement group, the last line is inserted 
automatically and the contained lines are indented correctly.  Statement 
groups are introduced with if, while, function, extend, on, and select.


\italic{Automatic fonting.}  Function names and the strings for extend and 
on are displayed in bold.  Comments will be displayed in italic if a 
readable italic font is found.


\italic{Key and Menu mapping}.  The menu option GetProc will cause the next 
keystroke or menu selection to be inserted in the document as the name of 
the proctable entry which would have gotten called for the selection.


\italic{Parenthesis checking.}  As you type a right side parenthesis, 
brace, or bracket, the corresponding left symbol is flashed.  Similarly, 
closure of a string flashes the start.


\italic{Error detection}.  Various token level errors are checked and 
flashed such as failure to close a string on a single line, incorrect 
number tokens, illegal special characters, and a mismatch of the word after 
"end" with the word at the start of the staement group.


\italic{Inset identification}.  After entering inset(), a click on an inset 
will insert its name.


\italic{Declaration insertion}.  As new identifiers are used, declarations 
are automatically inserted with an inferred type.



\subsection{Debugging Tools}


Debugging comes into action during execution of a Ness script.  It is 
activated by various menu options.  To get debugging with nessrun, use the 
-d switch.  These options are available:


Stack dump.  Displays the contents of the stack.   Provides for modifying 
the values in a stack frame.


Breakpoints.  Execution can be intercepted at a given point in the program.


Single statement execution.  One at a time.


Interruption on variable change.  Any "watched" variable will cause 
execution to be interrupted when it is changed.

\{\{Future: This version of the manual includes planned but non-existent 
features.  These are delimited by double curly brackets so they can be 
removed to form the manual itself.


Note that the invisible index entries in this document also have the style 
Hidden.  To make them visible, edit the style with a `lookz` inset.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{readonly()}\italic{readonly}(x) - returns 
a marker for a copy of x which is flagged as a constant.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{translate()}\italic{translate}(x, old, 
new) - strings old and new must have the same length.  The value returned 
is a copy of x with each place that formerly held a character among those 
in old replaced by the corresponding character in new.  For instance, 
translate("out out da*n spot", "otu", "urr") produces "urr urr da*m 
spur".\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{repeat()}\italic{repeat}(x, n) - where n 
is an integer.  Produces a string formed by concatenating n copies of 
x.\}\}}


\{\{Future: various sets of characters are provided as predefined 
identifiers:

	alpha_characters - upper and lowercase

	lower_characters - lower case letters

	upper_characters - uppercase letters

	digit_characters - 0...9

	whitespace_characters - space, tab, newline, carriage return, form feed, 
vertical tab

	punctuation_characters - ! : ; , . ?

	parenthesis_characters - ( ) \{ \} [ ]

	identifer_characters - alpha_characters, digit_characters, underline

	filename_characters - identifier_characters, period, (? what else)

	pathname_characters - filename_characters, slash

	control_characters - any non-printable character

\}\}


\description{\{\{Future: \italic{parseint}(m)  should delimit the search to 
the length of m.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \italic{parsereal}(m)  should delimit the search 
to the length of m.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \italic{firstobject}(m)  should delimit the search 
to the length of m.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: For an error WhereItWas should return an empty 
marker at the end of the original argument, m.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: textimage should be discarded because implicit 
conversion obviate the need for it\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: 
 \indexi{setformat()}\italic{setformat}(numericvar, format) - sets the 
formatting information for the named variable to be that given by the 
format string.  This format is used when the numericvariable is inserted in 
a string.  Format contents are (?) similar to format items in C.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{edit()}\italic{edit}(real, mask) - The 
real value is editted according to the mask and a marker for the result is 
returned.  The edit mask will specify the number of decimal places, the 
treatment of negative values, zero supression, and inclusion of currency 
and other symbols.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{stylediff()}\italic{stylediff}(m, p)  - 
 returns a marker for a one character string with the styles needed to 
change the style of p into m.  (Is this the right order for the 
arguments?)\}\}}


\{\{Future: \indexi{markerobject()}\italic{markerobject}(x) -  Returns an 
object value referring to the marker x.  Now the marker can be passed to 
functions as an object or even inserted in a sequence.  From the marker 
object the program can also retrieve a pointer to the text of which the 
marker selects a portion.\}\}


\{\{Future:  When assigning to an array element, the second argument to 
replace can be easily generated with a subsequence expression containing 
one element. \}\}


\description{\{\{Future:  currentselection should accept either marker or 
object as the argument.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future:  currentmark should accept either marker or object 
as the argument.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{lockscreen()}\italic{lockscreen}(boolean) 
- enables or disables screen updates.  Eventually there will be some 
mechanism so that all screen updating is discarded (not deferred) when this 
function has been called with the value True.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{screensync()}\italic{screensync}() - 
execution halts until screen update is complete in the window server.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{passdown()}\italic{passdown}() - This 
function must be called during the handling of an mouse, menu, or key 
event.  The way event interception works is to wrap a transparent inset 
called a cel around each inset.  When an intercepted event occurs, the 
interception is done by the cel, so the inset has not yet seen it.  The 
pass() function passes the event along to the object.  (Note that the 
passage is in the opposite direction from the pass operation in HyperTalk, 
where pass sends the event up the object hierarchy.) \}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{readline()}\italic{readline}() - reads 
from stdin and returns as many characters as are available, up to end of 
line.  This function is most useful in standalone applications.  It is 
probably meaningless in interactive execution.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{standalone()}\italic{standalone}() - 
Boolean.  True iff this execution was started with nessrun.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{starttimer()}\italic{starttimer}(object, 
event, milliseconds) - a timer is started which will expire at least the 
given number of milliseconds in the future.  When it expires, the named 
event is signalled for the named object.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{signal()}\italic{signal}(object, 
event-name) - pretends the object has signalled the event and executes the 
Ness code associated with that event.  Both object and event-name may be 
string constants or marker expressions.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{pause()}\italic{pause}(milliseconds) - 
execution halts for the specified number of milliseconds\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{filter()}\italic{filter(command, input)} - 
calls sh(1) on the command and passes the marker value of input as the 
stdin data for the command.  Waits for the command to complete and returns 
whatever the command wrote to stdout.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{filterinput()}\italic{filterinput(command)} 
- calls sh(1) on the command and passes the Nesses stdin as stdin for the 
command.  Waits for the command to complete and returns whatever the 
command wrote to stdout.  This function is useful for making standalone 
Ness functions part of a pipe, except that it waits for the subprocess to 
complete before returning a value.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{stderr()}\italic{stderr()} - returns 
stderr from most recent call to system(), filter(), or filterinput().\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{pwd()}\italic{pwd()} - Returns a marker 
value for the current directory of the process.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{cd()}\italic{cd(m)} - Changes the 
directory for the current process to m.  This also changes the environment 
for system(), filter(), and filterinput().  No return value.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future:\italic{ }\indexi{setenv()}\italic{setenv}(var, 
value) - Sets the environment variable var to the given value. Both 
arguments are marker values.  No return value.  The resulting environment 
will be used for subsequent calls to system(), filter(), and filterinput(), 
and will also affect any operation in the current process which later 
happens to interrogate the environment.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{unsetenv()}\italic{unsetenv}(var) - 
Removes the environment variable var.  Similar in scope and consequences to 
setenv().\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{getenv()}\italic{getenv}(var) - Returns 
the value in the environment for variable var.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{date()}\italic{date}() - returns a marker 
for the days date in form:  January 14, 1989 (Saturday).\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{time()}\italic{time}() - returns a marker 
for the time in form:  2:12 PM.\}\}}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{elapsed()}\italic{elapsed}() - returns an 
integer value giving the elapsed time in milliseconds since execution 
began.\}\}}


\{\{Future: The proctable must be augmented with ways to describe the types 
of parameters.\}\}


\{\{Future: Along with Ness will come tools for building and maintaining a 
list of all proctable entries in the system.\}\}


\{\{Future:  General conventions will be established to show which 
proctable functions can avoid the message line by supplying additional 
arguments.\}\}


\description{\{\{Future: \indexi{typename()}\italic{typename}(x) - For any 
value x returns a string giving the type.  If x is an object, its class 
name is returned.  Otherwise one of the strings "integer", "real", 
"boolean", or "marker".\}\}}


\{\{Future: \subsection{5.5 \index{Table access}}


Negotiations are underway for mechanisms by which Ness functions can access 
the cells of a table and tables can use Ness code to describe the values in 
cells.  These mechanisms will probably include functions for access to 
table elements and a new keyword after \bold{on}.\}\}

non-existent features.  These are delimited by double curly brackets so 
they can be removed to form the manual itself.\}\}}



\chapter{nessman.doc}



\italic{\{\{Future: This version of the manual includes planned but 
non-existent features.  These are delimited by double curly brackets so 
they can be removed to form the manual itself.\}\}}


\{\{Future:  It will be possible to compile Ness programs into C and thence 
into machine language.  It will then be feasible to do considerable amounts 
of system development in Ness alone.  Consideration for compilation has 
been an integral part of planning for Ness;  indeed, the present 
interpreter interprets a byte code that simulates a possible real 
machine.\}\}


\{\{Future: Possibly we will implement a type \bold{any}, to which values 
of any type may be passed.  Their type would need to be tested with 
typename() or a special form of the \bold{select} statement.\}\}


\{\{Future: The <statement-list> may be replaced with the word 
\bold{forward}.  Then the procedure can be declared later in the text.\}\}


\{\{Future: As a special case, if variable-name is a read-only value on an 
empty base, the old value is discarded and the variable will be made to 
refer to a new base string consisting of a copy of the ness-expression. 
 (This provision solves the problem posed by programmers who forget to use 
newbase().  However, it may lead to worse problems because now the program 
may have two variables referring to the same empty constant and after the 
string append they will refer to different bases so extent will not work.) 
\}\}


\{\{Future:  \subsection{Execute}

This statement, whose syntax is yet to be defined, compiles the enclosed 
code and executes it.  There is provision for passing values to the 
expression and retrieving the value returned by  it, but the expression 
does not have access to the global variables of the script containing the 
execute statement.  


One important application for the execute statement is to be able to read a 
search query from the user and compile it for execution to do the 
search.\}\}


\{\{Future: Eventually this will be fixed.\}\}


\{\{Future: The statement \bold{gotoelse} transfers control to just after 
the next succeeding \bold{else} or \bold{elif} which corresponds to a 
preceding \bold{then}.   (This operation is the same as \bold{fail}, as 
described and motivated by Kovats, T.A., "Comments on innovative control 
constructs in Pancode and EPN", \italic{SIGPLAN Notices}, Vol. 23, No. 12, 
pp. 151-157.) \}\}


\{\{Future: \subsection{Forall}


The \bold{forall} construct provides for executing a <statement-list> 
repeatedly, once for each instance of some pattern in a sequence:

\leftindent{
\bold{forall}  variable-name  \bold{:=} \leftindent{

\bold{find}  string-pattern 

\bold{in}  marker-expression}

\bold{do} 

\leftindent{statement-list}

\bold{end forall}}


The variable is declared by its appearance after forall to be a marker 
value.  For each instance of the string-pattern in the marker-expression, 
variable-name is set to a marker for the instance and the statement-list is 
executed.  variable-name is not the same as any other variable by the same 
name, and others of the same name cannot be accessed inside the 
statement-list.


For the simple pattern of selecting each element of the sequence in turn, 
the construct can be written without the colon-equal, the \bold{find}, and 
the string-pattern.


The statement   

\leftindent{\bold{exit forall}}

transfers control to just after the \bold{end forall} corresponding to the 
nearest preceding \bold{forall}.


\}\}


\{\{Future: \subsection{Select}


The select construction provides for execution of one of a number of 
different statement-lists depending on the value of an expression:


\leftindent{\bold{select}  ness-expression  \bold{from}

\leftindent{\bold{case} ness-expression  \bold{:}  statement-list

\bold{case} ness-expression  \bold{:}  statement-list

	. . .}

\bold{end select}}


The first expression is evaluated and its value is tested against each of 
the other expressions in turn.  When an equal match is found, the 
corresponding statement-list is executed and control proceeds to just after 
the \bold{end select}.  The word \bold{else} after \bold{case} will match 
True against any other expression; this option should obviously be the last 
in the sequence.  

\}\}


\{\{Future: Types should be coerced in most cases.\}\}


\{\{Future:  When used as a string expression a Boolean value is converted 
to one of the strings "True" or "False".\}\}


\{\{Future: When used in a string expression, an integer value is converted 
to the corresponding string of decimal digit characters.  When assigned to 
a real value, passed to a real parameter, or in a mixed expression, an 
integer value is converted to real.\}\}


\{\{Future: Comparison for equality accepts a small epsilon of error.  This 
includes the test for zero in sqrt() and log().\}\}


\{\{Future: Conversion occurs as required.  For assignment and passing to 
an integer parameter, real is converted to integer by rounding.  When used 
as a string value, reals are converted according to %g.\}\}


\{\{Future: When used in a string expression, object values are converted 
to strings by producing the hex representation of their address.  If a 
string containing object o is desired, use a sequence expression: \{o\}. 
 \}\}


\{\{Future: Maybe we need a different assignment operator for marker 
assignment.  Say ":-".  Some cT authors get confused between copying 
strings and assigning marker values.\}\}


\{\{Future:  Is some way needed to specify the collating sequence?  Will 
this slow down string operations unacceptably?\}\}


\{\{Future: Marker values can also be generated by sequence expressions. 
 Such an expression is delimited by curly braces and contains a sequence of 
items, separated with commas.  For example,


	\{ 3 , "abc", True, 5 ... 7 \}


An item can be an expression or an integer enumeration.  Non-marker 
expressions ( 3 and True in the example) are evaluated to produce a value 
which is then stored as an object in the sequence.  (If viewed, a default 
view is used.)  Marker expressions ("abc" in the example) are evaluated and 
the components of the resulting string are copied as components of the 
sequence.  An integer enumeration (5 ... 7 in the example) has the form


	integer-expression ... integer-expression


or


	integer-expression ... \bold{by} integer-expression ... integer-expression


Both of the latter forms denote the sequence of integers ranging from the 
left limit to the right;  in the second form the increment is given by the 
middle expression.  The sequence generated by the example is a marker value 
with the elements


	 3 a b c True 5 6 7 


where the letters are stored as characters and the other elements are 
objects of one form or another.


The function markerobject(), can be applied to a marker to yield an object 
which can be stored in the sequence (in this case, we have general lists.) 
 A sequence expression returns a marker for the entire generated 
sequence.\}\}


\{\{Future: The event specification for -on mouse- may be one of 
 \italic{any,  up,  down,  left},  \italic{right},  \italic{left up}, 
 \italic{leftup},  \italic{right up},  \italic{rightup},  \italic{left 
down,  leftdown,  right down,  rightdown}.  The word \italic{pass} may also 
be included; it indicates that the mouse hit is to be sent through to the 
object with dohit(currentinset, mouseaction, mousex, mousey).  Pass may 
appear at the beginning or end of the specification, in which case the 
event is passed to the object before or after execution of the statement 
list, respectively.\}\}


\{\{Future:  /on event "save"/ specifies an event which occurs whenever the 
component is saved.  Are there other generic events which are needed?\}\}


\{\{Future: Alphabetic characters from the Latin-1 ISO-8859 set are 
accepted in identifiers.\}\}


\{\{Future: Within a long string there may appear a marker expression 
delimited by <| ... |>.  The string expression will be evaluated and will 
replace the delimiters and the expression.  Evaluation will occur whenever 
the string constant is fetched from memory to be used in an expression; the 
result will be a read-write copy of the constant, which latter will remain 
for the next time it is accessed.\}\}


\{\{Future: Curly braces will be used to delimit sequence constants.\}\}


\{\{Future: When an embedded Ness is saved, a first line is inserted--or 
revised if present-- to show the author, date, and checksum for the 
program.  The author and date provide help for a user deciding whether to 
execute the program.  The checksum encodes the syntax level so the system 
can automatically convert the program from one syntax to the next; it also 
provides some assurance that the program is indeed the one saved by the 
given author on the given date.\}\}
