\formatnote{\chapter{<classname>}}


In a nutshell, what is this class?  (i.e., What is a short definition?)  What 
does it allow the application programmer (other readers) to do?  What is an 
example?  When would an application programmer (other readers) want to use it? 
How does it fit into ATK (if appropriate)?



\section{About this section}


What classes does the section assume the reader already knows about?  Any 
sections that are optional but useful to know about?  What sections/volumes 
are related to this one?


What are the things that only certain users (e.g., application programmers 
using a class (e.g., text/textview), inset/application programmers 
sub-classing a class (e.g., creating ctext/ctextview), system maintainers) 
need to know about?


What is the organization of this section? (use if the section is long an 
complex)
