\chapter{FILLER}


The \italic{filler} object and its companion \italic{fillerview} provide a 
simple user interface for selecting an object to go into a newly-created 
inset.  This file provides programmer documentation; the user interface is 
described in the filler help file.



\subsection{Filler}


\italic{Filler} does not extend its base class, \italic{cel}.  Its only reason 
for existence is to get fillerview started during initialization.




\subsection{Fillerview}


Fillerview provides a simple graphic interface which displays a list of 
possible insets and allows the user to select one by clicking.  It extends its 
base class, celview, as follows:


\italic{fillerv_SetDataObjectByName}(self, dataname) fills in the inset with 
the named data object.  If the first three letters of the name are "Ask" it 
prompts for a name.  Although the filler remains present in the object 
hierarchy, it is not visible in the view tree and functions only to provide 
cel functions.
