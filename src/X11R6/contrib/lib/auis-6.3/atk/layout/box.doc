\chapter{BOX}


The \italic{box} object and its companion \italic{boxview} provide a way to 
draw (and print) a box around an arbitrary ATK object.  It is intended for use 
in a \italic{layout}.



\section{User Interface}



Box has no user interface of its own.  It simply passes all input into the 
contained object and passes all graphics and out back back out.


A newly-created box fills itself with a \italic{filler}, which in turn gives 
the user a choice of what the real contents of the box should be.
