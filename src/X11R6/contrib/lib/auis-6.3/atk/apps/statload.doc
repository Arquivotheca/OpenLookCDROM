\chapter{Static Loading}




This file is intended to store programmer's documentation on static loading in 
ATK.  There is no short-term plan for completion of this file.  Programmers 
should refer to the documentation on Class (stored in 
andrew/overhead/class/Class.doc) for information on static loading.\
