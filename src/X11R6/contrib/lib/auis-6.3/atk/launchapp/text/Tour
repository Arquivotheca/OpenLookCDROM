\bold{\bigger{Welcome to the Andrew Toolkit tour!}}  What you are looking at 
is an ordinary ATK text document.


To see more of the text, use the \italic{scrollbar} at left.  Clicking the 
left mouse button in the scrollbar will scroll forward; clicking the right 
mouse button in the scrollbar will scroll backward.  The small rectangles at 
the top and the bottom of the scrollbar are the \italic{end zones}.  If you 
click here, you will go to the very beginning or the very end of the document.


All ATK operations are performed through keystroke commands, mouse actions, or 
menu selections.  ATK provides two kinds of menus:  \italic{pop-up menus} and 
\italic{pull-down menus}.  Pop-up menus will appear anywhere in the window 
when you press the middle mouse button.  \smaller{[If you only have two 
buttons on your mouse, press them both at the same time.]}  Pull-down menus 
are selected from the \italic{menubar} above by left-clicking on a menu title. 
 To select an operation from either kind of menu, drag the mouse pointer until 
the desired operation is highlighted, then release the mouse button.


If at any point in this tour the contents of a window look wrong, typing 
control-L (hold the control key, and type L) will redraw the window and fix 
the display problem.  Also useful is control-G, which always means ``cancel 
the current operation.''


The buttons below are ATK \italic{hyperlink insets}.  The hyperlinks are 
embedded within a \italic{table inset} and paired with \italic{text insets} to 
provide the side-by-side layout you see below.  ``Press'' a button (click on 
it with the left mouse button) to see more about a particular topic.
