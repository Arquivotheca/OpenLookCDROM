\bold{Chapter: Luke 2}


4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, 
to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house 
and lineage of David,  5 to be enrolled with Mary, his betrothed, who was with 
child.  6 And while they were there, the time came for her to be delivered.  7 
And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths, 
and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.


8 And in that region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over 
their flock by night.  9 And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and they 
were filled with fear.  10 And the angel said to them,  "Be not afraid; for 
behold, I bring you news of a great joy which will come to all the people;  11 
for to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the 
Lord.  12 And this will be a sign for you; you will find a babe wrapped in 
swaddling cloths and lying in a manger." 13 And suddenly there was with the 
angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,


\hanging{14 "Glory to God in the Highest,

and on earth peace among men with whom he is pleased."}


15 When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one 
another, "Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, 
which the Lord has made known to us."  16 And they went with haste, and found 
Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.  17 And when they saw it they 
made known the saying which had been told them concerning this child; 18 and 
all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds had told them.  19 But Mary 
kept all these things, pondering them in her heart.  20 And the shepherds 
returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it 
had been told them.


Note: In school one is told never to begin or end a sentence with and.


Note: The angel seems to think he knows to whom the child was born.  Was the 
father really one of the shepherds?

\bold{Chapter: Moby Dick LXXVIII}

Author: Herman Melville


[Tashtego, while emptying the oil from a whale's head, has fallen in nad the 
head has commenced to sink.  Queequeg dove in after both and eventually 
emerged dragging the victim.]


Now how had this noble resuce been accomplished?  Why, diving after the slowly 
descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its 
bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then dropping his sword, had 
thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards, and so hauled out our poor Tash 
by the head.  He averred, that upon first thrusting in for him, a leg was 
presented; but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be and might 
occasion great trouble;--he had thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave 
and toss, had wrought a somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, 
he came forth in the good old way--head foremost.  As for the great head 
itself, that was doing as well as could be expected.

\bold{Chapter: Luke 1}


26 In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee 
named Nazareth, 27 to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of 
the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.  28 And he came to her and 
said,  "Hail, O favored one, the Lord is with you!" 29 But she was greatly 
troubled at the saying, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this 
might be.  30 And the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have 
found favor with God.  31 And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear 
a son and you shall call his name Jesus.


\hanging{32 He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High;

and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David,

33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever;

and of his kingdom there will be no end."}


34 And Mary said to the angel, "How can this be since I have no husband?"  35 
And the angel said to her,


\hanging{"The Holy Spirit will come upon you,

and the power of the Most High will overshadow you;

therefore the child to be born will be called holy,

the Son of God.}


36 And behold, your kinswoman Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a 
son; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.  37 For with 
God nothing will be impossible."

10 Again the Lord spoke to Ahaz, 11 "Ask a sign of the Lord you God; let it be 
as deep as Sheol or high as heaven."  12 But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, and I 
will not put the Lord to the test."  13 And he said, "Hear then, O house of 
David!  Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also?  14 
Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign.  Behold, a young woman shall 
conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.  15 He shall eat 
curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good.  16 
For before the child knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the 
land before whose two kings you are in dread will be desserted. ..."

18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way.  When his mother Mary 
had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be 
with child of the Holy Spirit;  19 and her husband Joseph, being a just man 
and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly.  20 But as 
he considered this, behold, an angel of the Lored appeared to him in a dream, 
saying, Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary your wife, for that 
which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit;  21 and she will bear you a 
son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their 
sins."  22 All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the 
prophet:


\hanging{23 "Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son,

and his name shall be called Emmanuel"}


(which means, God with us).  24 When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the 
angel of the Lord commanded him; he took his wife, 25 but knew her not until 
she had borne a son; and he called his name Jesus.

Author: Hans Christian Andersen


"Let me look at the egg which won't crack, " said the old duck.  "You may be 
sure that it is a turkey's egg!  I was cheated like that once and I had no end 
of trouble and worry with the creatures, for I may tell you that they are 
afraid of the water.  I quacked and snapped at them, but it all did no good. 
 Let me see the egg!  Yes, it is a turkey's egg.  You just leave it alone, and 
teach the other children to swim."


"I will sit on it a little longer.  I have sat so long already that I may as 
well go on till the Midsummer Fair comes round."


"Please yourself," said the old duck, and away she went.


At last the big egg cracked.  "Cheep, cheep!" said the young one and tumbled 
out.  How big and ugly he was!  The duck looked at him.


"That is a monstrous big duckling," she said.  "None of the others looked like 
that.  Can he be a turkey chick?  Well, we shall soon find that out.  Into the 
water he shall go, if I have to kick him in myself."

1 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, 
behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem saying, 2 " Where is he who 
has been born king of the Jews?  For we have seen his star in the East and 
have Come to worship him."  3 When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, 
and all Jerusalem with him;  4 and assembling all the chief priests and 
scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.  5 
They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it is written by the prophet:


\hanging{6 `And you, OBethlehem, in the land of Judah,

are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;

for from you shall come a ruler who will govern my people Israel.'"}

\bold{Chapter: Sleeping Beauty}

Author: The Grimm Brothers


It happened one day that when the Queen was bathing, a frog came out of the 
water, and squatted on the ground, and said to her, "Thy wish shall be 
fulfilled.  Before a year has gone by, you shall bring a daughter into the 
world."


And as the frog foretold, so it happened.  The Queen bore a daughter so 
beautiful that the king could not contain himself for joy, and he ordained a 
great feast. ... As it drew to an end, the wisewomen stood forward to present 
to the child their wonderful gifts.  One bestowed virtue, one beauty, a third 
riches, and so on: whatever there was in the world to wish for.


And when eleven of them had had their say, in came the uninvited thirteenth, 
burning to avenge herself.  Without greeting or respect, she cried in a loud 
voice, "In the fifteenth year of her age the Princess shall prick herself with 
a spindle and shall fall down dead."  And without another word she turned away 
and left the hall.


Note: Beware of talking frogs.

-- Ness data base processor


--   Records in this data base begin with a line containing solely a dash (-). 
 Text prior to the first dash-line are retained at the beginning of the file 
by the sort package.


--   Fields in the record are denoted by lines beginning with a capitalized 
word followed with a colon.    The Birth data base uses fields Chapter, Chron, 
Browse, Author, Notes, and CF.  The first three of these are used for sorting. 
 


--    The CF field is processed specially: mouse hits in this line prior to 
the final semicolon cause the view to be moved to quotation cited.  The format 
of each citation is <book name> <chapter number>.<verse number><semicolon>. 
 The <book name> <chapter number> must match exactly the beginning of the 
Chapter: field for the target record.
