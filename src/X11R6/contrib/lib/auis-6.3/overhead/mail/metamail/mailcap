# Prototype Mailcap file

# as are rudimentary support for message, and application.
# However, any of these may be overridden in mailcap.

# Note that users may override or extend this with a .mailcap
# file in their own directory.  However, there is NO NEED
# for them to copy entries from this file, as metamail will
# pick up entries from both the system and personal mailcap files.
