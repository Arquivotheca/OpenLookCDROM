# Very simple shellscript to support recieving Macintosh files
# and store them in a UNIX filesystem used by the CAP AUFS program.
#
# To be able to use this script without modifications, you must
# first have the CAP package installed so you can mount the
# UNIX filesystem from the Macintosh. Second, you must have the
# program cvt2cap (which you can find in the contrib directory
# of the CAP distribution) which converts between CAP format
# to AppleSingle format.
