This directory contains the Bison A2.0 parser generator.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

It was once true that, when installing Bison on Sequent (or Pyramid?)
systems, you had to be in the Berkeley universe.  This may no longer
be true; we have no way to tell.

On VMS, you will probably have to create Makefile from Makefile.in by
hand.  Remember to do `SET COMMAND BISON' to install the data in
`BISON.CLD'.


Bison A2.0 is adapted from Bison-1.19 by Wilfred J. Hansen, Andrew 
Consortium, Carnegie Mellon University.   It 
differs from earlier versions in three  major ways:

	Errors in the input grammar are not fatal; all errors are 
		found in one pass.  A complete example and test case is 
		the file mess.y in the distribution.
		
	Tokens may now be specified as multiple-character strings:
		"<=" can appear where formerly would have to be LESSEQ.
		See the section on  @pxref{multiple-character literal}.

	The -n switch produces the parser tables without including
		the parser;  a project can now use its own parser
		and avoid the GNU license for the resulting application.
		See the @samp{--no-parser} switch.

Please send bug reports to wjh+@cmu.edu.  Please include the
version number from `bison --version', and a complete, self-contained
test case in each bug report.
