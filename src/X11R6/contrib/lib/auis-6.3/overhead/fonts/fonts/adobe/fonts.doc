This module provides all of the currently available details regarding the 
fonts used in the Andrew system.



\section{About this section}


This document corresponds to ATK version 11.8 or higher.



\section{About fonts}


Currently, the fonts that are used in the Andrew system are derived from adobe 
fonts.  A script is run to convert the adobe fonts into a format that can be 
handled by Andrew.


Initially, the font is in fdb format.  Since Andrew is portable across a 
number of windowing systems, the fonts which are installed must also be 
portable.  The fdb format is an ascii representation of the font data which 
can be translated into an operating system, window manager specific 
representation as needed.


In order to manipulate the font, it must exist in fwm format, meaning that it 
can be used with the wm window manager.  This step is necessary because the 
only font editor which exists is only available on wm.  Typically, one of our 
graphic designers checks the font using fe, the font editor program for wm. 
 The font is checked for consistency with existing fonts in the system, making 
sure that switching from the roman face to bold, italic or bold-italic does 
not cause the font baseline to shift and ensuring that all of the characters 
in the fixed pitch font are truly the same width among other things.


After these and numerous other consistency checks are successfully performed, 
the font is deemed suitable for installation in the system.  To achieve this, 
the wmfdb program is run on the font to convert the font from its wm-specific 
representation back into its more portable fdb format.  It is this fdb version 
of the font which is stored in rcs.


When the Andrew software is built, the fdb files are converted to their wm and 
x formats automatically by the installation software.  The fdbwm program 
converts fdb files into fwm format for use on systems running the wm window 
manager.  To create X versions of the fonts, several programs are used.  The 
fdbbdf program is used initially to create an intermediate bdf format font 
file.  This bdftosnf program is then used to convert the bdf file into either 
an rtx file, for use on RT AIX machines, or an snf file for use on other 
machine types that run the X window manager.  During the installation process, 
symbolic links are created to link the Andrew font names (e.g. andy10b) to 
their standard font name counterparts (e.g. tim10b).
