This directory is intended for scripts and/or programs directly related to conversions necessary due to changes in the 'Andrew' software.

The first such example is the R3toR4 shell script (r4conv.csh) which is supplied as a means to help programmers from outside the ITC to convert the references to Andrew include files that have had their names changed between the Release3 and Release4 tapes.

This script runs sed over the files and uses a static list of names that we know need converted. The conclass program uses the class indexing code and the current classpath to do the same thing, without being tied to a static list. In general , the conclass program should be used, unless it is important to 'jumpstart' some modules that need to be compiled before the itc supplied ATK programs. 

	Conclass reads either the supplied filename or standard input. It always writes to standard output. By default, it is designed to work on C files. The -h flag will do the conversion of .H files to .ch files (Note, this only provides the proper key name for the objects parents class, it may still be necessary for the user to fix up other parts of the file to eliminate warning the new class program may produce). A -r flag is also provided to convert back to the old style class names. This may be useful to those who have to maintain code in both worlds.

usage: conclass [-h] [-r] filename
-h is used to convert old .H to .ch files
-r reverses the process to convert new style back to old style
