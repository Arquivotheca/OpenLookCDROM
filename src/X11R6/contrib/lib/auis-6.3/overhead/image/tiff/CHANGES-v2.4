TIFF Software "Release" 2.4
---------------------------
Changes in libtiff:

Version 2.4.2 release:
    o The Group 4 encoding routine has been corrected to write an EOFB
      at the end of each strip; previously it wrote it only at the end
      of the last strip.
    o A new routine, TIFFTileRowSize has been added; it returns the
      number of bytes in each of row a tile.
    o The error+warning handler support has been changed so that clients
      can substitute handler routines at runtime with the new
      TIFFSetErrorHandler routine.  This was necessary for certain
      shared library implementations.
    o The picio and sgi compression schemes have been removed.
    o Some ANSI C and portability problems have been fixed.
    o A portability problem with tif_dir.c on Sun 4 machines was fixed.
    o LZW and fax compression routines were fixed to handle tiles correctly.
    o The calculation of tile size for images with only one tile was corrected.
    o IBM RS/6000/AIX portability "problems" were corrected.
    o An incorrect function prototype in tiffio.h was corrected.
    o A Makefile.aix was added.

Version 2.4.1 release:
    o The internals of the TIFF data structure are no longer public;
      this forced the addition of several query functions (thanks
      to JT Conklin).
    o The structure members tif_*encode* were renamed to improve the
      understability of the code (or so I think).
    o The encoding and decoding methods are now split out into separate
      row, strip, and tile entry points.  This was necessary so that
      compression algorithms that use the data organization can work
      properly/effectively.
    o The encoding and decoding methods now get passed the sample
      being encoded/decoded.  This value only makes sense when the
      image has PlanarConfiguration=2 (packed/interleaved data).  This
      is needed by JPEG.
!   o The ImageWidth and ImageLength tags are now ``treated'' as u_long
!     values.  In particular, td_imagewidth & td_imagelength are now
!     u_long and the get & set interfaces now assume u_long values.
!     NOTE THAT THIS IS AN INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE FROM v2.3 OF THE LIBRARY
!     AND REQUIRES CHANGES TO APPLICATIONS THAT USE THE LIBRARY.
!   o The interface to TIFFPrintDirectory has been changed to take
!     a bitset of flags that control the print of the large data
!     structures (e.g. the colormap).  NOTE THAT THIS IS AN INCOMPATIBLE
!     CHANGE FROM v2.3 OF THE LIBRARY ...
    o The library should work on Macintosh systems (although this may
      have been broken by my most recent changes).
    o All the supported compression algorithms are now conditionally
      compiled into the library.  This means that when you build the
      library, you only get the code that you request.
    o There was a bug where a directory tag w/ one SHORT inline value
      was not correctly processed.
    o All usage of the C-preprocessor to generate tokens through string
      concatentation has been eliminated.
    o The null compression logic now correctly handles more than a
      single scanline of data.
    o Support has been added for 2 features that are supposed to be
      part of TIFF version 6.0:
	tiled images	TileWidth, TileLength, TileByteOffsets, and
			TileByteCounts tags
	cmyk images	a PhotometricInterpretation definition and
			a new InkSet tag
      New library interfaces are provided for reading and writing tiles.
      Note that tiled images can NOT be read as strips and vice versa.
    o Basic functionality has been added in preparation for JPEG
      compression support:
	YCbCr photometric definition
	C-Cube JPEG tags (still may change)
        hooks to a stubbed out set of JPEG compression routines
      Support for JPEG-related tags is conditionally compiled into the
      library under the JPEG_SUPPORT define.
    o It is now possible to supply an I/O buffer for the library to
      use when reading+writing strips+tiles.  This can be combined with a
      change to the null decompression routine to avoid memory-to-memory
      copies.
    o Support is provided for 3D volumes of data through the TileDepth
      and ImageDepth tags (registered to SGI).  Note that the only
      way to read volumetric data is through the tile-based interface
      routines.
    o A new DataType tag, registered to SGI, specifies whether data
      is untyped, signed integer data, unsigned integer data, or
      IEEE floating point data.  The BitsPerSample tag must be
      consulted to determine the width of the data.
    o The Group 3 and Group 4 facsimile decoding routines have been
      rewritten to be faster and possibly more understandable.  Optional
      uncompressed data in G3-2D and G4 is now handled (though not
      generated).
    o The Group 3 encoding and decoding routines have been corrected
      so that an EOL code is now expected at the front of a line, instead
      of at the end.  When processing files written by older versions of
      this library, this can result in an off-by-one inconsistency
      between the value of the ImageWidth tag and the actual number of
      rows of data in an image.  This should not be a fatal error;
      although it will result in spurious "Premature EOF" messages.
    o An obscure bug in the packbits decoding logic was fixed.

Changes in the tools:

Version 2.4.2 release:
    o gif2tiff now generates 16-bit colormaps instead of 8-bit.
    o sgigt.c now handles 1-, 2-, and 4-bit palette images.
    o New -l and -m options were added to sgigt.c to force the
      FillOrder tag to be LSB2MSB and MSB2LSB, respectively.
    o A -ignore flag was added to tiffcp to ignore read errors
      when copying data.
    o A Makefile.aix was added.
    o Some cruft (e.g. hist.c, fixit.c) has been removed.

Version 2.4.1 release:
    o the contributed tools have been reorganzed in a separate
      "contrib" subtree.
    o tiff2ps has been virtually rewritten by Dan Sears and is now
      useful for printing B&W and color TIFF images on PostScript
      printers (although colorimage is required for color images).
    o sgigt.c now ignores read errors so that images w/ a recoverable
      error are now displayed more completely.  Error diagnostics
      have been made consistent. Images are read by strips or
      tiles, rather than the previous scanline.  An RGB window
      will be used if the hardware supports it and the image warrants it.
    o fax2tiff now properly sets the XResolution tag.
    o A bug in ras2tiff's handling of the colormap has been fixed.
    o tiffcp has new options to set the FillOrder tag.
    o tiffdither has new options for generating 2D Group 3 and
      Group 4 compressed images.
    o tiffdump understands the new tags added to libtiff.
    o tiffinfo has been updated to use the new interface to
      TIFFPrintDirectory.
    o a new tool sgi2tiff converts an SGI image file to TIFF; it
      requires the SGI -limage library and so is probably useful
      only on SGI equipment
    o a new tool gif2tiff converts a GIF87 format file to TIFF;
      this tool is based on Paul Haeberli's fromgif program
    o sgisv.c has been updated to use the documented interface
      for reading pixels from the display
    o Dan Sears has provided an updated version of contrib/dbs/xtiff
    o contrib.xtiff has been removed since it's out of date and most
      of its functionality has been subsumed contrib/dbs/xtiff.
