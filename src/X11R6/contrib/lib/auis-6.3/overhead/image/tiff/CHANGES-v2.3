TIFF Software "Release" 2.3
---------------------------
Changes in libtiff:
    o 2d Group 3 and Group 4 fax encoding/decoding are now suported
    o a new API routine TIFFFdOpen was added -- it opens
      a TIFF file given a file descriptor
    o the Group 3 algorithms have been changed to use some tables;
      this represents a tradeoff of increased space for lower time
    o support has been added for decoding compression algorithms 2 & 32771
    o the calculation used to guess the amount of data in a strip
      when the StripByteCounts tag is missing has been made more
      intelligent (or so we think)
    o a missing return statement at the bottom of TIFFDefaultDirectory
      has been added (mostly broke SPARC-based systems)

Changes in the tools:
    o fax2tiff now handles 2d encoded input data and can
      generate a Group 4 encoded TIFF file
    o tiffcmp now handles files that don't have
      BitsPerSample and/or SamplesPerPixel tags
    o tiffcp has -g3 and -g4 options for generating Group 3+4 
      compressed images; -2d and -fill options were also added
      for setting these Group 3-related options
    o tiffdither has a new -p option for setting the Group 3 fill
      option; it also now handles files w/o a BitsPerSample tag
    o tiffinfo now properly handles the directory number option
    o tiffmedian now handles files that don't have a BitsPerSample tag
    o Chip Chapin contributed a new version of contrib.xtiff
    o Chris & Dan Sears contributed a new version of contrib.dbs/xtiff

Changes in the doc directory:
    o ClassF.txt has been updated
