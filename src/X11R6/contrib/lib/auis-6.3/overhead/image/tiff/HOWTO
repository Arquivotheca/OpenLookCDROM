How To Obtain This Software (in case all you get is this file)

The software is available for public ftp on
    sgi.com			graphics/tiff/v3.0.tar.Z
	(192.48.153.1)
    ucbvax.berkeley.edu		pub/tiff/v3.0.tar.Z
	(128.32.130.12)

For example,
    ftp -n sgi.com
    ....
    user anonymous
    ... <type in password>
    cd graphics/tiff
    binary
    get v3.0.tar.Z

The software comes in a compressed tar file.  To extract the
information:
    zcat v3.0.tar.Z | tar xf -
(uncompress and extract individual files in current directory).

There is also a companion compressed tar file, v3.0pics.tar.Z
that has sample TIFF image files.  These are mostly useful in
testing the software if/when you port it to an unsupported system.
